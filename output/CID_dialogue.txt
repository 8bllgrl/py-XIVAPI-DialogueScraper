Character is speaking:
TEXT_VOICEMAN_03001_700080_CID -- Bloody typical... All right─we're going in!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03001_700100_CID -- All aboard!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03003_F00030_CID -- Impressive little thing, isn't she? My talent for ship design has plainly rubbed off on them.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03003_F00040_CID -- They've adapted the principles of corrupted crystal technology, and constructed a mechanism which converts aether from its surroundings into elemental wind. Said wind is then harnessed by the specially engineered sails, providing the craft with propulsion and lift. All in all, a most elegant solution...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03003_F00050_CID -- ...I'm actually a little upset that I didn't think of it myself.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03003_F00090_CID -- The new Ishgardian airship hasn't left the boys much time for tinkering─meaning it may be a while before this particular project takes off, if you'll forgive the pun.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03003_F00130_CID -- It seems you're required elsewhere. Leave the manacutter with us. We'll see that she's airworthy and suitably equipped to slice through those winds.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03003_F00140_CID -- You, meanwhile, should concentrate on providing Raubahn and the sultana whatever help they need!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400030_CID -- Ah, that explains it! When we first met in Ishgard, I very nearly called you Livia.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400160_CID -- Well, I for one am happy to welcome a fellow Garlean to our merry band─especially one who can make magitek armor sing!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_400190_CID -- Hold on, everyone!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500010_CID -- Look! I think that's it!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500030_CID -- Allagan, aye. There's no mistaking their handiwork.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500050_CID -- Some sort of barrier!?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03005_500090_CID -- Damn it all! Why do the Allagans always have to make everything so bloody complicated!?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03006_000010_CID -- ...In summary, the isle owes its lofty position to the industry of the Allagans. And we can be all but certain that the archbishop and his cronies are enjoying the view from its top.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03006_000030_CID -- If we are to join them, we will first need to pass through the isle's aetheric barrier─which is, alas, more powerful than most. Powerful enough to make a mess of a perfectly good airship, at any rate...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03006_000040_CID -- As far as I can gather, the barrier mechanism draws aether from the surrounding environment, and polarizes its elemental aspect to produce what is, in effect, a wall of lightning.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03006_000060_CID -- Alas, the key was careless enough to leave without us, and I don't think the Vanu keep a spare.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03006_000080_CID -- Well, in the past, we've beaten similar barriers by nullifying them with elemental converters.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03006_000090_CID -- But the one we're up against this time dwarfs aught we've encountered before. The <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> simply isn't large enough to bear the requisite amount of crystals.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03006_000110_CID -- That said, we're not without options. If it isn't feasible to nullify the barrier, we might try <Emphasis>piercing</Emphasis> it.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03006_000130_CID -- We create a ram of condensed aether and mount it on my ship. There's just one problem─I don't have the faintest idea how to build one. It's going to take a true authority in the field, I reckon.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03006_000170_CID -- Hah, fortune favors the righteous, eh? Well then, let's not waste any time. While you go and look for our missing friend, I'll work on modifying the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>. Her hull will need reinforcing to bear the punishment, not to mention a mount for the ram.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03006_000180_CID -- Just you wait, my pretty─by the time I'm finished, you'll be an airship reborn!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03007_000010_CID -- Ah, excellent timing! We've just finished our work on the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>. She's so much improved, I've decided to give her a new name to suit:

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03007_000010_CID -- Ah, excellent timing! We've just finished our work on the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>. She's so much improved, I've decided to give her a new name to suit:

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03007_000020_CID -- The <Emphasis>Enterprise Excelsior</Emphasis>! Or simply the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis>, if pressed for time.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03007_000030_CID -- Once again, she'll carry Eorzea's protectors into battle!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03007_000080_CID -- <Emphasis>Enterprise Excelsior</Emphasis>...engage!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03007_100010_CID -- This is it! Get ready!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03007_100040_CID -- Yaaaaaargh!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03007_100070_CID -- Damn it! The bastards were waiting for us to open the door for them!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03007_100080_CID -- I'm going to try to shake them! Hang on to something!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03007_D00030_CID -- Haha! Godsdammit, do you always have to cut it so bloody close!?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03008_200010_CID -- Remind me: why is there no rest for the righteous?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03008_200030_CID -- Of all the things they could have picked to play with... That's not a toy, you bloody fools─it's a primal!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03401_000010_CID -- All right! Time to deactivate the barrier!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03401_000020_CID -- Argh!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03401_000030_CID -- Godssake! I didn't count on the bloody thing moving!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03401_000040_CID -- The smoke is too thick! Can't see a damn thing! You'll have to press on alone!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001300_CID -- Agreed. There is, however, the small matter of how to get close enough to a being that swats warships from the sky as you would a bothersome gnat...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001320_CID -- What in the hells are <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> doing here!?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001360_CID -- What do you want, Nero?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001420_CID -- And, what, you just expect us to accept? Why would we trust the word of a man who furnished the Black Wolf with the means to subjugate Eorzea?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001430_CID -- And, what, you just expect us to accept? You're a fool if you think your deeds at the Crystal Tower were enough to win my trust, Nero.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001490_CID -- Spare us, Nero! The Seedseer's concern is a valid one. He who controls Omega wields the power of the gods. The very power which led the Allagans to destroy themselves.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001510_CID -- Hah. A creed you follow, is it?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001520_CID -- <sigh> What say you? Do we take this villain at his word?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001530_CID -- He makes me grind my teeth is what he does, but I suppose we don't have much of a choice.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001540_CID -- ...As will I. I don't like it, but then it doesn't look like we have much choice.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001550_CID -- Would the council be willing to entrust this matter to a pair of former imperials?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001910_CID -- How convenient. ...You've been here before.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001940_CID -- Trust? Aye. I trust your appetite for technology.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_001990_CID -- Godsdammit, I can't let Nero tinker around in there by himself. Sorry to leave you to it─but I daresay you'll manage without me. This clod has no idea who he's dealing with...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_002020_CID -- All clear on this side! It's waking up...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_002040_CID -- I still don't see any means to control the machine directly. It seems to have been designed to act wholly autonomously... Hmm.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_002050_CID -- Once we release Omega, we can be fairly certain it will attempt to capture the primal at Baelsar's Wall. Assuming its mission is successful, our only option at that point will be to reengage its stasis system and put it back to sleep.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_002110_CID -- Uh...yes. That's the one.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_002140_CID -- The launch sequence has begun. Omega is loose.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_002150_CID -- Hm? Omega has stopped transmitting. But that shouldn't be, I─I didn't engage the stasis system.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03500_002180_CID -- Right, I've ordered the malfunctioning beast to go to sleep. That should prevent any unfortunate mishaps. I suggest we make our way back to Gridania.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000570_CID -- Good work, you two. This is all we asked for and more. Quite a lot more, now that I look at it...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000580_CID -- Lord Aymeric, eh? And entirely by chance? Hah! Some people have all the luck.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000620_CID -- Ask Jessie. She was the one who hired you. All I know is you're an employee of the Ironworks now, so you'll bloody well earn your keep.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000630_CID -- For all the effort it took to track you down after your latest disappearing act, you could find the cure for death and it wouldn't be worth the trouble.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000660_CID -- Very well, then. I'll do a tenth of the work. Just the part that's beyond you.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000680_CID -- By the way, the healing applications of crystal foci proved very useful in getting us to where we are now. I must remember to thank Mikoto.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000690_CID -- Right! If everyone's ready, let's begin!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000700_CID -- All appears to be in order. Now we just have to wait for it to find us our magick. Why not take this opportunity to put your feet up? This may take a while...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000710_CID -- Damn it. It's overloading!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000730_CID -- We'll have to shut it down!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000750_CID -- No subtitles, report if shown.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000830_CID -- Don't be. It may fall short of dimension-hopping, but a cure for tempering is not to be sniffed at.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000840_CID -- This, my friend, is a world-changing discovery. One we're proud to have had a hand in. A few magitek terminals are a pittance to pay.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05400_000860_CID -- Well, we've done what we can. The rest is up to you.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_004510_CID -- What's this about a ship that can fly to the moon?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_004520_CID -- And why didn't you mention it sooner? The one time you don't beg my aid, your problem's a bloody ship that can fly to the moon!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_004540_CID -- Of course! Garlond Ironworks' finest. You need only point us towards my new favorite ship...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_004550_CID -- Oh, I nearly forgot. We stopped by Werlyt before coming here and picked up a package from Gaius.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_004560_CID -- He's still of the mind that actions make for better penance than words─contrite or otherwise─so he offered none of the latter.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_004570_CID -- What he sent is an Allagan relic Valens used in his Weapons experiments─has a fair bit of refined adamantite in it, too.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_005240_CID -- Finally!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_001340_CID -- I've seen my fair share of tight schedules, but this was bloody murder...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_001350_CID -- But we did it. We finished the ship.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_001360_CID -- It's safe, fit for purpose, and looks good to boot. Aye, it's a Garlond through and through.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_001380_CID -- Don't mention it. Ever since that episode with Omega, I've been toying with the idea of star-faring vessels.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_001390_CID -- And as they say, necessity is the mother of invention. We've learned a lot, let me tell you.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_001400_CID -- Well, the work was hard, but we've learned a lot from it. After all, it's not every day you get tasked with building a star-faring vessel.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_001410_CID -- In case you're wondering about payment, the ongoing existence of the world ought to do. But feel free to throw in a colorful recounting of your journey on your return.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_001420_CID -- So, have you thought of a name?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_001440_CID -- Well, seeing as its purpose has changed, I thought a more eloquent name was in order. I suggested as much to Fourchenault, who seemed quite amenable to the idea.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_008700_CID -- Yes!

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_017 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Just the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> we need!

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_019 -- Quite well! The device is nearly ready─though attaching the damnable thing to Syrcus Tower took every onze of ingenuity the Ironworks has got. But it should produce the energy we need.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_020 -- With just a little more fine-tuning, we can open a rift. I'm here to request your presence at the tower.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_021 -- I'll leave Biggs and Wedge at the Eight Sentinels as guides. And do hurry, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I'm sure you wouldn't miss another chance to save the world, would you?

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_050 -- My friends, you've arrived. I'm just waiting for my engineers to give the signal. Then, we'll see if we can't open a gateway to another world!

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_051 -- Hm? Is there something amiss, G'raha?

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_052 -- ...Ahhh, Emperor Xande's throne─how the mighty have fallen, eh? Once, it stood as a symbol of Allag's art and power. Now, it's nothing more than an empty chair.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_053 -- Just imagine if Allagan civilization had lived on, and a just emperor still sat on that throne. How different would our history be, how much further would we have advanced? <sigh> Unfortunately, there was no stopping Xande and his ambition.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_060 -- The Fourth Umbral Calamity... I'd learned of its cause from Unei and Doga. I had no idea that rebellion incited Xande to rashness, though.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_061 -- Your knowledge of Allagan history is astounding, G'raha. Why, a man could study for two lifetimes and only learn half of what you know.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_063 -- Yes? Ah, Biggs, are you ready?

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_066 -- Good! Then let's get started!

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_067 -- Our preparations are complete. Everyone, step away from the throne.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_068 -- All right, let's see what this machine can do. Now, Biggs!

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_070 -- We can't break out the mead just yet. The tough part's still ahead. We've broken into the dark realm, but the gate's not all that stable: it won't stay open forever, and only a few can use it.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_071 -- I, for one, will remain here to ensure the voidgate stays open.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_156 -- You owe me, Nero.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_CID_000_180 -- Nero never would've made it back without you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and for that you have my thanks. I doubt he will hatch any more dastardly schemes for the present. He owes me his life, after all.

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_CID_000_014 -- I'm not sure about our resident historian, but Nero left the tower with me. Where he's vanished to since, I cannot say.

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_CID_000_015 -- But knowing him as I do, I don't believe he'll scheme against us for the time being. ...Though he <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> still Nero.

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_CID_000_053 -- G'raha, the Crystal Tower's strength poses too great a threat to Eorzea now.

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_CID_000_054 -- We would need technology as advanced as Allag's to use it correctly. As things stand, we barely understand the tower's workings. Hells, we may <Emphasis>never</Emphasis> fully comprehend them.

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_CID_000_057 -- What!? You cannot mean that!

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_CID_000_062 -- Nothing we say will make you change your mind, will it?

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_CID_000_063 -- Onwards to a brighter future... It won't be easy, of course. But that's exactly why we'll do it!

TEXT_GAIUSE615_00427_CID_000_035 -- (-???-)Alphinaud, my boy─sorry to keep you waiting!

TEXT_GAIUSE615_00427_CID_000_037 -- Pulling you out of the fire, as usual! Your merchant friend told me everything.

TEXT_GAIUSE615_00427_CID_000_039 -- I hid the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> but a short distance away. All I need is a destination.

TEXT_GAIUSE615_00427_CID_000_042 -- That settles it. With me, everyone!

TEXT_GAIUSE615_00427_CID_000_050 -- Up, up! There's no rest for the righteous!

TEXT_MANFST401_00518_000160_CID -- (-Cid-)Who...are you?

TEXT_MANFST401_00518_000160_CID -- (-Cid-)Who...are you?

TEXT_MANFST401_00518_000290_CID -- (-Cid-)I...I have...an airship?

TEXT_MANFST401_00518_000290_CID -- (-Cid-)I...I have...an airship?

TEXT_MANFST401_00518_000320_CID -- (-Cid-)A-An airship...? My airship...?

TEXT_MANFST401_00518_000320_CID -- (-Cid-)A-An airship...? My airship...?

TEXT_MANFST401_00518_000330_CID -- (-Cid-)W-Wait...

TEXT_MANFST401_00518_000330_CID -- (-Cid-)W-Wait...

TEXT_MANFST401_00518_000350_CID -- They need my airship... They need...me.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_000 -- According to my tests, the device is now functioning in perfect harmony with the crystal─meaning we can leave whenever you're ready.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_001 -- But you must understand: tests can only tell one so much.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_002 -- Until we approach the Howling Eye─until we attempt to breach the barrier itself...I cannot be sure that this will work.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_003 -- I think it only fair to tell you that there is a small but statistically significant chance that the crystal could trigger a massive...

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_004 -- Hmmm... Mayhap it is better that we remain positive.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_005 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I want to thank you. For reuniting me with my ship, for trusting in me to develop this plan...for everything. You've helped me to rediscover a part of myself I'd forgotten. I am not the man I once was, and I do not know if I ever shall be...but I <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> know one thing: this feels right.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_006 -- ...My apologies for the sudden outpouring of sentiment. I would have waited until after the mission, but...well, you understand.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_000010_CID -- There...she's ready...

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_000050_CID -- Phew...

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_000060_CID -- Damn it!

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_000070_CID -- I...I once flew in this airship. And I was not alone.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_000080_CID -- There were adventurers on board...adventurers like you.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100090_CID -- Just how long have I worn these damn goggles?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100100_CID -- Ah, yes. I fancied myself a trendsetter in my younger days.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100110_CID -- The young prodigy, admired by all...exactly like his father.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100120_CID -- Born and raised in Garlemald...

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100130_CID -- It was only natural that the precocious young student should become an engineer. Had his father not done the same?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100140_CID -- Father... When did we stop seeing eye to eye?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100150_CID -- When did Meteor become your everything, and your loved ones cease to matter?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100160_CID -- You abandoned us all. But he was there for me, Father─there for me when you were not.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100170_CID -- Though he proved no better in the end. Gaius was just another man with an all-consuming obsession.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100180_CID -- And so I ran─left the Empire behind and came to Eorzea, where I built the Ironworks.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100190_CID -- Ah, yes! It was then that I first donned these goggles.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100200_CID -- Eorzea opened my eyes. It was home to so many manner of people, each with their own hopes and dreams. People worth saving. And so I fought beside them.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100210_CID -- I wanted to prove that my knowledge could serve a nobler purpose.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100220_CID -- I wanted to prove that there was another way...

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_100230_CID -- And it all began that day, when I found my new home...

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_200240_CID -- I had forgotten how wonderful it was. The wind in your hair, the endless sky...

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_200250_CID -- That light─it was you, wasn't it?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_200260_CID -- It's surprising how few people know this, but <Emphasis>all</Emphasis> pureblood Garleans have a third eye.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_200270_CID -- Perhaps mine helped me recognize you─or perhaps it was just a lucky guess.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_200280_CID -- The <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> was made for this! To carry Eorzea's protectors into battle!

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_200290_CID -- I am proud to be able to call her my own.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_200310_CID -- Alphinaud, my boy─sorry to have been such a burden.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_200320_CID -- I remember everything...

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_200330_CID -- My name, my people, and my purpose. Everything.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_200340_CID -- Come! It would be rude to keep Garuda waiting!

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_300350_CID -- It took a while for the memory to return, but I remember you.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_300360_CID -- The floating isle, van Darnus... We ended it, that day─or so we thought.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_300370_CID -- Listen─let's keep this between the two of us, for the time being.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_300380_CID -- If word got out that one of the Warriors of Light had returned, the eyes of the world would soon be upon us─our enemies' included. And that's the kind of attention we could well do without.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_300390_CID -- What, isn't it enough that <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> know the truth?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_300400_CID -- Don't worry. A <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> of your talents won't go unnoticed for long. Someday, they <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> remember you─and you'll never know another moment's peace!

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_300410_CID -- There, up ahead! Ready, old friend?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_300420_CID -- Hah! Some things never change! We're going in!

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_054 -- As I live and breathe...

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_055 -- Over there─look.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_056 -- Amalj'aa and kobold prisoners. But why would the Ixal bring them here...?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_062 -- Did we not take to the skies, and slip your defenses!? We are bound by <Emphasis>nothing</Emphasis>, Garuda!

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_066 -- Leave the Ixal to us, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! We will keep them distracted while you deal with her!

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_081 -- What!? How in the hells─!?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_000_090 -- Then let's stop them!

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_600500_CID -- Gaius!?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_600520_CID -- What!?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_600540_CID -- I...

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_600600_CID -- Seven hells, does she still mean to fight!?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_600650_CID -- Stop gawping, boy! We must <Emphasis>run</Emphasis>!

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_700790_CID -- That was Gaius van Baelsar, legatus of the XIVth Imperial Legion, and supreme commander of the Garlean invasion force in Eorzea.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_700810_CID -- I was never so naive as to think the man would abandon his ambitions, but these developments are beyond my worst expectations...

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_700820_CID -- What have you been doing these past five years? How could something of this magnitude have escaped the Alliance's attention?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_700840_CID -- Damn it, Gaius, where in the seven hells did you find that thing?

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_700870_CID -- Which just leaves the matter of Gaius's new toy.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_CID_050_031 -- You know, it's not easy guiding the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> through a ceaselessly swirling wall of wind. I would rather not risk our lives again until you're sure─meaning absolutely <Emphasis>certain</Emphasis>─that you're ready. Are you?

TEXT_MANFST405_00520_CID_000_100 -- Wait.

TEXT_MANFST405_00520_CID_000_105 -- Not that I'm aware of! It's been a while, Yda.

TEXT_MANFST405_00520_CID_000_107 -- This place has seen better days.

TEXT_MANFST405_00520_CID_000_116 -- ...Why would <Emphasis>he</Emphasis> want them?

TEXT_MANFST405_00520_CID_000_160 -- I...I had no idea, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I can only imagine how you felt when you returned that day...

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_000 -- How go your preparations, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? We leave as soon as you're ready.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_001 -- Glaumunt! You came!

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_003 -- Well, we'll do our best! Hmmm... It occurs to me, for all the help you've afforded us, we know little and less about you. What did the Empire do to earn your ire? ...Ah, but I fear I've put curiosity before consideration. I quite understand if you'd rather not relive those memories.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_010 -- You give us too much credit, Glaumunt. We seek only to rescue our friends.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_013 -- And you are sure that will satisfy you? If you wish to strike back at the Empire with your own hand, you need only say the word. We would be glad to have you with us.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_018 -- Wherever the Empire goes, misery invariably follows in its wake.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_019 -- For the sake of all who call Eorzea home, we must put an end to Gaius's ambitions.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_020 -- But first, we have friends to rescue.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_021 -- Biggs, Wedge, and I will lie in wait east of Castrum Centri, just outside the stronghold's patrol perimeter.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_022 -- Join us when you're ready.
Oh, and don't forget to wear your disguise, or this will be the shortest rescue mission in history.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_040 -- There you are. A patrol should be heading back to the castrum any moment now, so for gods' sakes, don your disguise.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_041 -- If you've misplaced your disguise, hurry back to Revenant's Toll. Glaumunt told me that he'd acquired some additional helms and robes for just such an eventuality. Whatever you do, though, do it <Emphasis>swiftly</Emphasis>. We need you here and in imperial uniform if this plan is going to work.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_050 -- This is it, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Time to rescue our comrades.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_100 -- Forgive me for saying so, but you <If(PlayerParameter(4))>look rather fine<Else/>cut quite a dashing figure</If> in imperial black and crimson!<If(PlayerParameter(4))> <Emphasis>Definitely</Emphasis> your colors!<Else/></If> Ahhh, but now is not the time for jests.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_101 -- Let's review the infiltration plan. Castrum Centri lies just beyond.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_102 -- A short while ago, an imperial patrol left to do its rounds.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_103 -- Alphinaud and I will create a diversion out here and keep them occupied for as long as we are able. Meanwhile, the three of you will enter the stronghold, posing as the patrol returning from duty.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_104 -- Should Alphinaud and I prove less distracting than hoped, I will contact you via linkpearl. Be ready to beat a hasty retreat.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_105 -- Wedge will lead the way in the reaper. Stay close to him.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_106 -- And I hardly need tell you this, but don't do anything suspicious!

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_107 -- Oh, and lest you wonder, Yda and Y'shtola left shortly before you arrived. We had planned that they should linger in the vicinity, to cover our retreat in the event that Alphinaud and I attracted too much attention─but the approach of an imperial vehicle forced us to improvise.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_108 -- Don't be too disappointed─they did at least leave a message for you. Something along the lines of “don't do anything reckless,” if memory serves. Wise words.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_109 -- All right, the imperial patrol should be returning any moment now. You'd best be off.

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_CID_000_110 -- Good luck, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! May the Twelve keep you!

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_300310_CID -- This is Cid! Can you hear me!?

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_300310_CID -- This is Cid! Can you hear me!?

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_300320_CID -- I need you to count to five, then jump! Understood!?

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_400410_CID -- <gasp>

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_400420_CID -- What in the seven hells─!?

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_400480_CID -- Damn you, Gaius!

TEXT_MANFST407_00521_400550_CID -- We have to go now! Hang on!

TEXT_MANFST408_00522_000410_CID -- A great man once said that a shrewd merchant grasps not for the quick profit, but invests in the future. Wise words...eh, Raubahn?

TEXT_MANFST408_00522_100700_CID -- But the fire in their hearts has been rekindled, and they will fight to the last.

TEXT_MANFST408_00522_100770_CID -- I'll be whatever and wherever you need me to be!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_010 -- The <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> is at your disposal. When you're ready to head for the Praetorium, you need only say the word.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_011 -- If we succeed in destroying the Ultima Weapon, it will deal a crippling blow to the Empire's hopes of conquest. After that, the XIVth Legion would not dare to move against us─barring the discovery of further Allagan doomsday devices, that is...

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_012 -- Let's be on our way, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Gaius and his plaything await!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_015 -- The <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> is at your disposal. When you're ready to head for the Praetorium, you need only say the word.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_300 -- So here we are...

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_301 -- The Ultima Weapon will almost certainly be housed in the depths of the complex.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_302 -- You know, the sort of place a Warrior of Light would boldly go with no thought for personal safety. Oh, if <Emphasis>only</Emphasis> one were with us!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_303 -- This is it, my friend!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_340 -- Gaius!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_343 -- ...What of him?

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_345 -- But he did <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> wash his hands of it. He helmed the project until the day it killed him!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_349 -- You ripped open walls in this place just so you could say this to me!? What is it you want, Gaius!?

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_351 -- My father had a change of heart─you said so yourself! Besides, I have long known my destiny, and I assure you, it lies <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> with the Empire!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_356 -- Gaius, wait! ...Damn it!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_370 -- Knowing Gaius, he is headed for the Ultima Weapon. If we find him, so too will we find our quarry.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_371 -- With these instruments, we can monitor every nook and cranny in the castrum.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_372 -- I think it's time we divided our forces. Pray go on and give chase. I'll track your movements from here and guide you through the complex.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_373 -- We'll stay in contact via linkpearl. Be careful, all right?

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_400 -- Ah, there she is!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_401 -- I trust you recognize our old friend. “Maggie,” was it? They must have shipped her here from Centri.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_402 -- Considering all she's been through, it's a wonder she's still operational. Tough old girl!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_403 -- Now that you're suitably armed, you can blast open that bulkhead. The external walkway will take you back there.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_404 -- Follow it till you come upon a way down to the lower level.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_450 -- That bulkhead is composed of a special alloy. <Emphasis>Extremely</Emphasis> tough. Ordinary fire won't leave a mark, I'm afraid.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_451 -- You'll need to divert all power to the magitek cannon, as I did at Castrum Meridianum.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_452 -- The armor's core is like to expire from the strain, but there's no help for it if we want to press on.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_453 -- Now, listen well. Press...<buzzzzzz>...the control...<fizzzzzz>...engage ancillary...then fire away. Don't mind the warning lights.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_454 -- You're a natural at this! All right, the way's clear, but it's just you and your own two feet now, so be careful.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_501 -- Is someone there!?

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_503 -- ...Nero? Is that you!?

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_505 -- The highest ranking tribunus of the XIVth... It was <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> all this time?

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_507 -- Uh...what? You've lost me.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_513 -- Nero, I...I don't know what to say.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_518 -- Nero! What are you─!?

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_553 -- Are you all right!?

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_554 -- What of Nero!? ...Fled!? Damn it!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_555 -- In the instant prior to the blackout, the instruments detected a massive power surge from the deepest chamber.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_556 -- Gaius is certain to be there! We have no time to waste!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_557 -- Word arrived from the Alliance a short while ago. It seems the Order of the Twin Adder has completed its blockade of Castrum Centri.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_558 -- What hands they can spare are hastening this way even as we speak, and likewise for the Maelstrom. All that's left is to destroy the Ultima Weapon!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_559 -- ...I should warn you: the chamber which houses the target appears to be saturated with aetheric energies. There's bound to be heavy interference.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_CID_000_560 -- But even if we lose contact, you must go on. Just don't do anything I wouldn't do, all right?

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_200010_CID -- Look for the lift's control panel─it'll be somewhere nearby.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_200020_CID -- Take the lift down, and you should find yourself in the chamber of the Ultima Weapon.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_200030_CID -- Keep your eyes peeled─Gaius could be waiting for you down there.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_200040_CID -- Oh, and don't even <Emphasis>think</Emphasis> about dying. You're too bloody useful!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_200050_CID -- The interference is getting worse. I don't think the connection will last much─

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_A00960_CID -- Nothing. Nothing at all.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_A01030_CID -- I wholeheartedly agree! But flying into the midst of <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> would only add to the fireworks!

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_A01140_CID -- Oh, you mean our adventurer friend? Did I forget to mention <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> was one of the Warriors of Light?

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_A01150_CID -- Saved Eorzea, you know. Twice.

TEXT_MANFST503_00524_A01210_CID -- Yes! The hero returns!

TEXT_MANFST600_00525_000040_CID -- Mind your horns there, man-bull!

TEXT_GAIUSB914_00937_CID_000_000 -- Might I have a word with you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? It concerns the chirurgeons. After speaking with them earlier, I learned that they lack sufficient alembics for their needs, you see...

TEXT_GAIUSB914_00937_CID_000_001 -- So I used some of their broken equipment to craft a more advanced alembic─both as a gesture of goodwill, and as a means to help me recover my memories, since working with my hands kindles familiar feelings.

TEXT_GAIUSB914_00937_CID_000_002 -- All I require to complete the device are the cores of six ice sprites. Though commonly used to reduce the temperatures of alchemical mixtures, there is a way to alter their properties so that they draw the cold within rather than radiate it without.

TEXT_GAIUSB914_00937_CID_000_003 -- It must sound ridiculous to you─impossible, even. Yet somehow I <Emphasis>know</Emphasis> it will work.

TEXT_GAIUSB914_00937_CID_000_020 -- Have you obtained the cores? If so, please show them to me.

TEXT_GAIUSB914_00937_CID_000_038 -- Why does that man detest us so? Is it all because we interrupted Lord Francel's trial?

TEXT_GAIUSB914_00937_CID_000_039 -- Whatever his reasons, he clearly means to oppose us at every turn...

TEXT_GAIUSC001_00938_CID_000_000 -- Before we can persuade Lord Drillemont to help us, it seems we must convince Inquisitor Guillaime that we are not his enemy. But just how might we go about doing that...?

TEXT_GAIUSC001_00938_CID_000_001 -- We know little and less about the good inquisitor, despite him being such a prominent figure in Coerthas. Perhaps we should learn more by speaking with the people of Whitebrim Front.

TEXT_GAIUSC001_00938_CID_000_002 -- Share your findings with Alphinaud in the square. I'm sure he can formulate a strategy from there.

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_CID_000_061 -- Yes...just beyond that enormous sleeping dragon.

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_CID_000_067 -- As you command...

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_CID_000_074 -- Alphinaud! The dragon!

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_CID_000_105 -- Yes...though it will not be a pleasant ride.

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_CID_000_109 -- This is all so familiar. I...I <Emphasis>know</Emphasis> this airship. If I could just...

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_CID_000_110 -- Bah, it's no use.

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_CID_000_111 -- ...Let's go.

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_000 -- 

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_020 -- It calms me to look at her.

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_021 -- It's as though I've been reunited with a part of me I never knew was missing...

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_026 -- You are. Frankly, it's a miracle she carried us this far.

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_028 -- Given time, I believe I can fully repair her...

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_029 -- But if this tempest is as fearsome as you say, even that may not be enough.

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_031 -- ...The <Emphasis>elements</Emphasis>. But of course! That's it!

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_032 -- We work upon the element itself! Using the power of a corrupted crystal, we could clear a path through the storm, and spare the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> a battering!

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_037 -- The point is, we could theoretically use a corrupted crystal to convert the wind-aspected aether comprising Garuda's barrier into aether of another aspect─one she cannot control.

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_038 -- With certain modifications, the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> should be able to deliver us to the Howling Eye in comfort, however hard Garuda blows...

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_040 -- No. But I know a man who might. A scholar by the name of Lamberteint, who resides in Camp Drybone.

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_CID_000_041 -- Strange as it may sound, I met him during my time at the church. Well, <Emphasis>Marques</Emphasis> met him, I suppose. Whether out of pity, or for want of a more willing listener, he would talk to me for hours at a time about his aetheric studies, corrupted crystals being his pet subject. It was as a result of these conversations that poor Marques was observed to possess an uncommon knack for theoretical science...

TEXT_GAIUSC308_00975_CID_000_010 -- All repairs and modifications have been completed, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Once you bring me that crystal, nothing will stand between us and Garuda.

TEXT_GAIUSC308_00975_CID_000_020 -- I'll need to run some tests to be sure, but this looks to be exactly what we need.

TEXT_GAIUSC308_00975_CID_000_021 -- Worry not, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I'll see that your hard work doesn't go to waste.

TEXT_GAIUSC308_00975_CID_000_022 -- The <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> is already more than a common airship. But mark my words: soon it will become something greater, something <Emphasis>extraordinary</Emphasis>.

TEXT_GAIUSC308_00975_CID_000_023 -- This...this is me. This is what I was born to do.

TEXT_GAIUSC403_00978_CID_000_059 -- What did you say?

TEXT_GAIUSC403_00978_CID_000_061 -- Well, I'll be damned...it's Biggs and Wedge! Trust those two rascals to escape...

TEXT_GAIUSC403_00978_CID_000_062 -- We must find them, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and <Emphasis>soon</Emphasis>!

TEXT_GAIUSC403_00978_CID_000_063 -- The imperials will not rest until they are captured or killed, and if Biggs were given the choice, I fear he'd take the latter.

TEXT_GAIUSC403_00978_CID_000_069 -- Thank you, everyone! You won't regret this.

TEXT_GAIUSC406_00981_CID_000_025 -- It's me, Cid. Have you had any success?

TEXT_GAIUSC406_00981_CID_000_025 -- It's me, Cid. Have you had any success?

TEXT_GAIUSC406_00981_CID_000_026 -- ...Tracked down Wedge!? That's wonderful news! Now, what of Biggs?

TEXT_GAIUSC406_00981_CID_000_027 -- ...I see. Well, it hardly surprises me that the big fellow went off as he did. For all the tongue-lashings he gives Wedge, he's always taken care of him.

TEXT_GAIUSC406_00981_CID_000_028 -- I've scoured the area surrounding the Darkhold, but have nothing to show for it. At any rate, we know for a fact that Biggs headed west. With both Yda and Y'shtola helping out, I'm sure he'll turn up soon.

TEXT_GAIUSC406_00981_CID_000_029 -- Now then, I'll make my way over to your position while keeping an eye out for Biggs.

TEXT_GAIUSC406_00981_CID_000_030 -- If memory serves, there should be an Ishgardian fortification not far to your west─Monument Tower, I believe it's called. Let us meet there.

TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_CID_000_070 -- Biggs! Wedge! Gods, it's good to see the two of you again!

TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_CID_000_073 -- When Alphinaud told me of the raid on the Waking Sands, I feared the worst. What happened?

TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_CID_000_084 -- Carry on.

TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_CID_000_093 -- Castrum Centri...

TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_CID_000_100 -- What happened next?

TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_CID_000_103 -- Hah! If I didn't know better, I'd call that a likely story! Sabotaging the altitude controls of an airborne vessel!? That will have been Biggs's handiwork, like as not. You always were resourceful in a tight spot, my friend!

TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_CID_000_110 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─thank you for returning my dear assistants to me. It would seem I owe you yet another debt of gratitude.

TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_CID_000_111 -- There are still many questions in my mind, but the answers can wait─Minfilia and the others still want for rescue.

TEXT_GAIUSC408_00983_CID_000_120 -- All right, you lot─Garlond Ironworks is back in business! Let's go and give the imperials what for!

TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_000 -- Thanks to you, Biggs and Wedge are with us again.

TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_001 -- Now we must find a way to rescue Minfilia and the others. Gods know we've kept them waiting too long already.

TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_002 -- Based on what we've learned, I believe it's safe to say they're being held at Castrum Centri.

TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_003 -- So let us convene at Revenant's Toll in Mor Dhona─'tis as good a place as any to prepare, and better than most. The road leading east then south will get you there.

TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_004 -- When we arrive, let us seek the advice of the local adventurers. We're bound to learn a thing or two that will benefit our mission.

TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_024 -- Aye, it has to be good old-fashioned infiltration.

TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_026 -- Why, I've a mind to walk through the front door.

TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_028 -- Aye, we'll disguise ourselves as imperial troops and march right in.

TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_029 -- For this, we'll need a few sets of imperial uniforms, a suit of magitek armor, and impeccable timing.

TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_032 -- Then it's settled!

TEXT_GAIUSC411_00986_CID_000_060 -- Good work, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. As Alphinaud has already told you, we've plotted out a course for the rescue.

TEXT_GAIUSC411_00986_CID_000_061 -- The gist of it is unchanged: we disguise ourselves as imperial soldiers and infiltrate the stronghold.

TEXT_GAIUSC411_00986_CID_000_062 -- Glaumunt is looking into ways to procure a suit of magitek armor. In the meantime, I need your assistance for some preparation of my own.

TEXT_GAIUSC411_00986_CID_000_063 -- Minfilia and the others are counting on us, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Let's not keep them waiting any longer than necessary!

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_CID_000_000 -- While Glaumunt goes about devising his plan, we need to see to some preparation of our own.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_CID_000_001 -- It wouldn't do if the imperials were to discover that they're short an armor.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_CID_000_002 -- To prevent this from happening, I'm going to put together a makeshift communications-jamming device. The explanation is like to get a bit technical, so bear with me.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_CID_000_003 -- Imperial forces communicate at a distance via electromagnetic waves. Simply put, voices are borne upon aetheric lightning energy that permeates the air.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_CID_000_004 -- Now, the hill-sized cluster of corrupted crystals to the west has been observed to amplify the selfsame energy. By making use of this property, we should be able to drown out imperial voices.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_CID_000_005 -- To ensure that we have enough amplification, we must identify the most potent crystals among the cluster. For this, I need you to go there and use this device to take readings. I'll mark the likely places on your map.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_CID_000_006 -- Oh, and just so you know, plasmoids are drawn to lightning energy. Don't be surprised if you run into a few.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_CID_000_030 -- You have the readings? Excellent. Here, let me see the numbers.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_CID_000_031 -- ...Yes, four of these crystals should suit our purpose, though I pray that we won't have need of their power. My thanks, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_000_090 -- I hope you don't mind my joining. Seeing as we're seizing advanced weaponry, I thought it best to be on hand.

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_000_091 -- Ah, there she is.

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_000_300 -- At last, our very own suit of magitek armor!

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_000_301 -- Hmmm... Not wishing to look a gift chocobo in the beak, it does seem rather the worse for wear, doesn't it?

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_000_302 -- Biggs, Wedge─what's your honest assessment?

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_000_310 -- A hall has been set aside for our use in Revenant's Toll.

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_000_311 -- That's where we'll carry out the repairs. Look for us there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_000_900 -- We've now had time to take a closer look at the reaper. Our preliminary diagnosis was correct─she's structurally sound, but her servomechanism is faulty.

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_000_901 -- You needn't worry, though─Biggs and Wedge will see her restored to her former glory in no time at all. Give those two something to mend, and they will think of naught else till the job's done. 'Tis a marvelous thing to behold─provided you remind them to visit the privy.

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_BATTLETALK_01 -- Keep hitting the reaper till it stops moving!

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_BATTLETALK_02 -- Put down all of the foot soldiers, then concentrate on the reaper! A few scratches can't be helped!

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_BATTLETALK_04 -- It's not easy being an engineer...

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_BATTLETALK_05 -- Damn it! The armor has gone into overdrive! If you value your life, stay out of its sights!

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_BATTLETALK_06 -- Hah! That did the trick!

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_CID_BATTLETALK_DEAD -- Ugh... Out of my depth... Bloody...idiot.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_000 -- The repairs are proceeding apace. It shouldn't be long now before Biggs and Wedge complete their work. There is, however, one small problem...

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_001 -- As you may recall, the machina's servomechanism was discovered to be faulty. Wedge has subsequently ascertained that the magitek core which drives it is worn beyond use.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_002 -- Such cores are rather fragile devices which must be replaced at regular intervals. Thanks to the negligence of our imperial colleagues, however, the one used in this reaper was long overdue.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_003 -- Alas, we do not have access to a ready replacement here in Mor Dhona. But all is not lost: Wedge thinks he may have identified an alternative solution. Go and see him, would you? He'll explain the details to you.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_044 -- This is the Ironworks' first major project since my return. I mean to see that it's a success.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_100 -- I take it Wedge's suggestion has given you pause. Well, I don't blame you. The lad <Emphasis>does</Emphasis> have some rather unorthodox ideas. Still, orthodoxy did not give us language, tools, clothes...or machina. Short of a better idea, I don't suppose it would hurt to try.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_701 -- No doubt you're wondering why the servomechanism is so important as to warrant this silliness.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_702 -- Without it, the pilot would be required to control the armor's every movement manually. This would be an onerous task at the best of times, and wholly impractical during battle.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_703 -- Using a mammet heart in place of the worn magitek core seemed a promising solution. Alas, the device does not appear to be compatible with Garlean technology.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_704 -- Wedge, are there no other ways we might demonstrate our appreciation to our friend here?

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_707 -- Damn it! They have us cornered!

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_711 -- The hells you will!

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_716 -- Bloody hells... <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─protect the armor at all costs!

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_741 -- Ah, <Emphasis>now</Emphasis> she deigns to grace us with her presence!

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_742 -- It took us a good while, but we're finally ready.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_743 -- It's time to infiltrate Castrum Centri and rescue our comrades!

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_910 -- The servomechanism is now fully functional─and all it took was a simple fight to the death. Remind me <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> to install a mammet heart aboard the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, would you? Much as I love her, I would rather not be required to profess it before boarding. But enough of that. Let us see to our final preparations.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_000_911 -- Thanks to Biggs and Wedge, the reaper is as good as new. We're as prepared as we're like to get!

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_BATTLETALK_02 -- You're not undoing our hard work!

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_CID_BATTLETALK_DEAD -- Don't...let them take... Ungh...

TEXT_GAIUSC901_01036_CID_000_550 -- That light─ <gasp> The magitek transporter!

TEXT_GAIUSC901_01036_CID_000_557 -- 'Tis I! It seems you've done it again, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!

TEXT_GAIUSC901_01036_CID_000_558 -- I'd raise a tankard to you, but I'm afraid we've no time to savor the victory. There's still the small matter of infiltrating Castrum Meridianum and destroying the Ultima Weapon!

TEXT_GAIUSC901_01036_CID_000_559 -- I know, I know...no rest for the preternaturally gifted. Now stop feeling sorry for yourself, and make your way back to the Immortal Flames' encampment. The communications officer will issue you your orders. I'll be waiting for you with the main host.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_000_013 -- (-???-)<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!? I <Emphasis>thought</Emphasis> it was you!

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_000_014 -- What brings you to Saint Coinach's? Don't tell me─the Alliance has sent you on another realm-shaking, history-making mission to lay low an apparently insuperable foe, yes? <Emphasis>No</Emphasis>?

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_000_016 -- <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> has, has <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If>? Glad to have you aboard, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! You...don't have the faintest idea what you've volunteered for, do you? Very well, let us begin at the beginning.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_000_017 -- The Sons of Saint Coinach are tasked with unearthing the secrets of the long-fallen Allagan Empire, and this present endeavor aims to delve more deeply into the civilization's mysteries than ever before.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_000_018 -- ...Ah, but I know that look. In the event that you feel ill equipped to contribute much on the subject of Allagan archaeology, I invite you to recall your encounter with the Ultima Weapon.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_000_019 -- That mechanical monstrosity represented a feat of engineering far beyond aught Garlemald can presently achieve─Nero tol Scaeva simply awoke it. I mention this by way of a reminder that you have had what one might term...<Emphasis>extensive firsthand experience</Emphasis> with a notable Allagan relic. In short, you're practically an archaeologist.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_000_020 -- Now, to the core of the matter: here in Mor Dhona, there stands an entire Allagan structure which we have yet to investigate. I speak, of course, of the Crystal Tower.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_000_021 -- After witnessing the destructive capabilities of the Ultima Weapon, and the lesser moon, Dalamud, before it, it seems wise to treat any remnants from that era with the utmost caution. They must be analyzed, monitored, and─above all─kept from falling into the wrong hands.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_100_021 -- To put it plain: I have no wish to see another megalomaniacal legatus wield one of those weapons. It was this thought which first moved me to contact the Sons and propose that the tower be explored.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_100_022 -- For several millennia, the Crystal Tower remained hidden, buried deep underground. But, like so many other things that were better left undisturbed, the structure was freed from its stony prison by the great upheaval which accompanied the coming of the Seventh Umbral Era. It now stands revealed in all its splendor, a gleaming spear of crystal, pointed at the bosom of the heavens.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_100_023 -- We believe the tower to be the repository of much of the ancients' wisdom. Unfortunately, its entrance is guarded by formidable defenses, and we cannot so much as peep through the keyhole, much less set foot inside.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_101_023 -- These defenses take the form of statues, carved into the likeness of giant swordsmen. “The Eight Sentinels,” as the Sons are wont to call them, is the first barrier we must overcome.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_102_023 -- Why not simply fly over them in an airship, you ask? It's been tried before: any vessel that ventures too close to the tower is blasted out of the air. We either destroy those statues, or the front door is forever beyond our reach.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_CID_000_025 -- If I didn't know better, I'd say you had a taste for these deadly escapades! I look forward to working with you again.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_067 -- I fear I can't accompany you this time. The unenviable task of facilitating communications between our forces has been entrusted to the Ironworks, you see. Know, though, that I will be praying for your safe return.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_140 -- If I didn't know better, I'd swear you had a personal grudge against magitek armor.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_141 -- What can I say? I couldn't bear to let you have all the fun.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_142 -- Don't worry─Biggs and Wedge have everything in hand. Truth be told, I think they <Emphasis>like</Emphasis> having the work of three men.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_143 -- Wedge wasn't exactly pleased to be left behind, though, and made quite sure I knew it. I must say, our recent struggles have done <Emphasis>wonders</Emphasis> for the lad's spirit.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_144 -- Given the size of this place, I suspected there might be an armor or three to be had. And here we are.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_145 -- Hmmm...not as bad as I thought. If I have <Emphasis>half</Emphasis> Marques's talent for mending things, I should be able to get it working again.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_146 -- Listen, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─we intercepted an imperial communication indicating that the Ultima Weapon is indeed being housed within the Praetorium.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_147 -- We also learned that the field which protects the compound is powered by no fewer than three generator towers.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_148 -- If you're to deactivate the field, you'll need to locate and disable them all.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_149 -- And I'm here to help you do just that.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_150 -- See that chute? It leads to waste disposal.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_151 -- Somewhere nearby, there will be a ceruleum facility supplying fuel to the closest of the three towers.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_152 -- Find the place and break things.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_153 -- Go on ahead, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I'll be along as soon as I finish my repairs.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_200 -- There you are!

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_201 -- I didn't have the patience to take the long way 'round.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_202 -- I see you've disabled the first generator. That leaves us with two.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_203 -- Ah, bugger. That was me, wasn't it?

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_204 -- Well, there's nothing for it but to press on. We must see to the remaining generators before the enemy has the chance to regroup!

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_205 -- You go on ahead, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I'll bring up the rear!

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_206 -- Let's raise some hell!

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_220 -- Fine work, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_221 -- Stand clear. I have a mind to loose some fireworks.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_222 -- Diverting all power to cannons!

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_223 -- Damn it. There goes the core. I fear I may have overestimated its maximum operating capacity...by a few orders of magnitude. I blame Marques.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_224 -- Ahem. We'll need to find another way to bring down the third generator.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_225 -- Well, well...the traitor himself. And with his meddlesome friend for company.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_226 -- You go on ahead, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I need to get to the bottom of something.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_260 -- It's me! Are you all right!?

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_261 -- That's an assault craft you're up against! You don't stand a chance with conventional weapons!

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_262 -- You're going to need something big to bring it down. A mortar, a cannon─anything!

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_263 -- Hold on, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I'm on my way!

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_363 -- Another poor fool who craved Gaius's affection over all else... May her soul know rest.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_364 -- 'Tis a miracle no harm has come to you, my friend. One for which I will happily give thanks.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_365 -- And thanks to your fine diversionary work, we've succeeded in bringing down the generator tower─and with it, the magitek field!

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_366 -- The way to the Praetorium now lies open. The only problem is, we can't reach it on foot.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_367 -- Nay, we'll need to take the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>. I left her at the Ceruleum Processing Plant, so let's regroup there.

TEXT_MANFST502_01136_CID_000_368 -- This is it, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! The final confrontation awaits!

TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_CID_000_073 -- I shall set to work immediately. Truth be told, I've been looking forward to this. One does not encounter materials like these every day.

TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_CID_000_074 -- Speaking of which, how in the seven hells did you find them? Mistake me not, old friend─I know only too well how capable you are, but aethersand isn't something you simply find gathering dust at the back of a merchant's rare gem cabinet.

TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_CID_000_075 -- ...You had help from Biggs and Wedge?

TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_CID_000_076 -- Hmph! Trust them to design a revolutionary new engine the moment I turn my back. How's a genius meant to rest on his laurels when his employees are so damnably <Emphasis>inventive</Emphasis>, eh? And now they're determined to join us, are they? Typical!

TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_CID_000_077 -- I jest, of course. It will be good to have them around. Still, as a matter of professional pride, let's endeavor to procure the two remaining varieties of aethersand before they arrive, shall we? Tell me, Rammbroes─have we any information on where the water- and wind-aspected types might be hiding?

TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_CID_000_079 -- Forgive me for observing, but you seem less than enthusiastic about that prospect. If there's a complication, I'd rather we discuss it now than risk jeopardizing the expedition.

TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_CID_000_062 -- There. That should do the trick!

TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_CID_000_064 -- Oh, it was a trifling matter, I assure you. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> here is the one you should be thanking. Anyway, by my reckoning, there's nothing stopping us from striding up to the Allagans' front door!

TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_CID_000_066 -- Biggs! Wedge! Come to lend a hand, have you?

TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_CID_000_068 -- I appreciate your enthusiasm, lads, I really do, but we're not here to take this knowledge for ourselves.

TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_CID_000_069 -- Twice in the last decade, the promise of unimaginable power has prompted men to meddle with technology they do not understand, and the realm has been dragged unto the very brink of oblivion on both occasions. We shall not be so irresponsible as to risk another.

TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_CID_000_070 -- Wedge, do you recall our company's creed?

TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_CID_000_072 -- Exactly. Freedom. When we forsook our homeland, we swore that we would have no truck with machines that could be used to promote tyranny. That has not changed. Should you feel tempted to break your oath, remember this: the wonders of the all-knowing Allagan Empire could not save their civilization, and have damn near doomed ours. Twice.

TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_CID_000_073 -- That is why we must explore the Crystal Tower, and, if needs be, seal away its secrets.

TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_CID_000_081 -- ...“Noah”?

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_010 -- The Crystal Tower lies beyond this portal. Now comes the interesting part...

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_013 -- Lucky for us that it is. One might otherwise stroll past them... Feast your eyes on the elemental defenses which prompted our lengthy preparations. These sentinels prevent would-be intruders from advancing to within twenty yalms of the tower's inner reaches.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_015 -- Happily, the crystal fangs we took such pains to craft should spare us the inconvenience of instantaneous annihilation. Here, allow me to demonstrate.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_017 -- Dangerous to allow anyone else to risk his life testing one? Quite right. I made the damn things─it's my job to see that they work.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_018 -- ...Success!

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_020 -- This last one is yours, old friend. It seemed only right...

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_023 -- Speaking of blood─I have a proposal for the next stage of the expedition.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_024 -- I suggest we wait here while <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and a handpicked party of <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> adventuring companions enter the tower.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_026 -- We did─and we will. But our investigations must proceed at a more measured pace.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_027 -- If the outside of the place is this well defended, can you imagine what awaits us on the <Emphasis>inside</Emphasis>? Only a true hero could reasonably hope to brave the hazards ahead and live to tell the tale.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_028 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> here fits that description better than anyone I know.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_029 -- And it is not as if we shall be idle in <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> absence. While <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> companions are risking life and limb to beat us a path to the tower, we can set about analyzing this rubble for evidence of how its technologies function.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_030 -- Your knowledge of ancient lore will be invaluable in that endeavor, Historian G'raha Tia.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_040 -- Ho there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_042 -- The scale of this structure defies comprehension... Someone plainly thought bigger was better.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_046 -- And you gleaned that from what exactly? His choice of weapon?

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_050 -- Well, well, there it is...the foot of the tower. What surprises do <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> have in store for us, I wonder...?

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_CID_000_051 -- I can't tell you how glad I am to have you with us on this little jaunt, old friend. Had you not beaten a path through that maze, I very much doubt we'd be standing here now...

TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_CID_000_022 -- In short: our misgivings were well founded. The Crystal Tower was not simply thrust above ground by the chaotic shifting of earth─it has somehow been <Emphasis>reawoken</Emphasis>.

TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_CID_000_023 -- If, as seems increasingly likely, the tower's secrets should prove too dangerous to share with the world, we will have no choice but to contain them. Short of leveling the place, this will almost certainly involve returning its mechanisms to a state of dormancy. To do <Emphasis>that</Emphasis>, however, we will first need to address the question of how they work─the answer to which must surely be waiting for us inside the tower itself. In conclusion: that is where we must go.

TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_CID_000_026 -- It would be my pleasure.

TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_CID_000_029 -- Lads... Well, I hope you're ready for some backbreaking chores!

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_060 -- Ah, some old faces to lift the spirit...and a couple of new ones besides.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_063 -- If your attire is aught to go by, your assistance should prove invaluable indeed.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_064 -- To begin with, let me tell you where we stand. Beyond rises Syrcus Tower, the principal spire of the structure collectively known as the Crystal Tower.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_065 -- The only way to get inside is through the proverbial front door─the imposing gate you see here. The problem is, we can't get it to open. It's sealed by some mechanism whose workings are an utter mystery to us.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_066 -- Having had no success via more <Emphasis>orthodox</Emphasis> methods, I went at it with everything from a pickaxe to a magitek cannon. Nothing so much as put a scratch on it.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_067 -- For a blessing, the gate doesn't try to reduce us to ashes like the Eight Sentinels, but that doesn't make it any less effective a security measure. It's fiendishly frustrating in its simplicity.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_070 -- If you're thinking to force it, save your strength. It's no use─just ask the calluses on my hands.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_074 -- Seven hells... What is this? What did you do? What...what <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> you?

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_078 -- N-Nero!? You're still alive!?

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_082 -- After the wrongs you've committed? You think us that gullible?

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_094 -- Seven hells, do you <Emphasis>seriously</Emphasis> mean to follow us around?

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_110 -- It goes without saying that Nero can't be trusted. We'd do well to keep an eye on him at all times.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_157 -- Darkness...<Emphasis>again</Emphasis>? Seven hells, what is it with megalomaniacal rulers turning to darkness in their lust for power?

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_158 -- Well, at least this one won't be bothering us, being thousands of years dead and all.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_184 -- Well, that'll teach me for speaking too soon... Setting my chagrin aside, I see now why you knew about the Students of Baldesion among a host of other things─you were observing our investigation the whole time.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_185 -- So, what will we do, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? The world's in grave danger again, and it just so happens you're an expert at saving it.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_210 -- Technology made the Allagans great, but so too did it prove their downfall. And now the Garleans are treading in their very footsteps, the bloody fools. It's true what they say: history repeats itself.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_254 -- What are you playing at now, Nero?

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_271 -- What are you going on about!?

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_293 -- Nero! Were they part of your grand plan, too?

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_100_298 -- Nero!

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_301 -- Damn it, the rift is gone! What are we supposed to do now?

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_302 -- As much as it pains me to leave without them, there's precious little we can do. Let us return to the Find and consult Rammbroes.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_315 -- Rammbroes may know a way to bring our friends back. Let's consult him without delay.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_335 -- However dreadful it may be, we can't abandon our friends. Is there no way to save them?

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_338 -- Damn it... I feel so helpless...

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_347 -- I am with G'raha.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_348 -- However slim the odds, we must try to save Unei and Doga. Aye, and that bastard Nero as well, if only to make certain that he won't make any more mischief.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_CID_000_353 -- We'll save them yet, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Mark my words!

TEXT_HEAVNA116_01595_CID_000_040 -- The gods only know what might've happened had we not been around to save you... No need for thanks, though. It's not as if you haven't done the same for us on a few previous occasions. All right, more than a few.

TEXT_HEAVNA116_01595_CID_000_041 -- 'Twas but blind chance that brought us together this time, in case you were wondering. The Holy See has petitioned the Ironworks for assistance with this creation of theirs, the <Emphasis>Protector</Emphasis>. Apparently, they just can't seem to get her flying.

TEXT_HEAVNA116_01595_CID_000_042 -- Anyway, I came to Camp Cloudtop to cast an eye over the ship, only to learn that you had arrived some few days before with an Ishgardian lordling in tow.

TEXT_HEAVNA116_01595_CID_000_043 -- "Small world!“ I thought─just as said lordling's manservant skittered into view, babbling about his master having been captured and you risking all to rescue him. And the rest, as they say, is history.

TEXT_HEAVNA116_01595_CID_000_044 -- Right, well, I hate to cut short our reunion, but I am here on business after all, and the boys are already hard at work. Don't worry, old friend─we'll speak again soon, I promise.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_CID_000_030 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Alphinaud! How fare you both? Not terribly well, judging by your faces.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_CID_000_032 -- ...Another wind barrier? And you say it was conjured by Nidhogg?

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_CID_000_033 -- Hm. The <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> could certainly take you where you need to go...but she would not fare well against dragons. She's agile for a ship her size─but not <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> agile. The Dravanians would fly rings around her.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_CID_000_034 -- And if they took it into their heads to incinerate the rigging, there would be precious little we could do to avoid them.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_CID_000_037 -- All right, all right, I didn't say it was impossible. I said it was impossible for the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>. We need a smaller boat.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_CID_000_038 -- Biggs! Wedge! It's time we gave that new toy of yours a proper field test.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_CID_000_039 -- It's probably best if I let the lads show you. Come on, the manufactory's not far!

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_CID_000_041 -- The Ishgardians have granted us the use of a small corner of their workshop─all part of the agreement. I think you'll see we've made the most of the space...

TEXT_HEAVNA332_01633_CID_000_010 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! How in the seven hells do you do it? I was just about to send for you! We have but this moment completed the manacutter's first successful test flight!

TEXT_HEAVNA332_01633_CID_000_011 -- A few minor adjustments and she'll be ready to go. While we see to the finishing touches, you might want to pay a visit to Fortemps Manor─a dragoon by the name of Estinien was looking for you.

TEXT_HEAVNA332_01633_CID_000_012 -- Loitering around here won't speed matters up. Leave the boys to apply the finishing touches, and go and see your friend.

TEXT_HEAVNA332_01633_CID_101_030 -- Just a few more adjustments, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. She'll be ready.

TEXT_HEAVNA333_01634_CID_000_010 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, old friend! The 'cutters are ready when you are!

TEXT_HEAVNA333_01634_CID_000_013 -- And that, my friends, is a Garlond Ironworks guarantee!

TEXT_HEAVNA333_01634_CID_000_016 -- Give that overgrown lizard a kick in the tail from me, eh? We'll be waiting for you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!

TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_CID_000_010 -- Ah, the dastardly duo. What mischief have you two been getting up to lately?

TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_CID_000_012 -- ...He was a good man.

TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_CID_000_014 -- No, but it's probably some source of phenomenal cosmic power that's key to his plans.

TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_CID_000_015 -- From what he told <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, the Ascians tried to tempt him as they tempted Gaius with the Ultima Weapon. Even if he spoke true about playing along, I can see him attempting to seize it.

TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_CID_000_017 -- Well, I'm convinced. The <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> is at your disposal. Come to the airship landing when you're ready to depart.

TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_CID_000_018 -- Heh, it's just as well. After pulling you <Emphasis>out</Emphasis> of the fire these last few times, I reckoned I was due to deliver you into it.

TEXT_HEAVNA502_01643_CID_000_010 -- The boys have been hard at work preparing for our flight, and I'm pleased to say we are ready to depart.

TEXT_HEAVNA502_01643_CID_000_011 -- That is, as soon as a certain... Ah.

TEXT_HEAVNA502_01643_CID_000_014 -- Come, come─we can continue this discussion aboard the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>!

TEXT_HEAVNA502_01643_CID_000_040 -- We'll keep the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> here for now, but if you need to head back to Ishgard, you can use that standard to signal for an Ironworks airship.

TEXT_HEAVNA502_01643_CID_000_041 -- Don't worry─we charted a route safe enough for others to fly...unless that primal shows up. But what are the odds of that, eh?

TEXT_HEAVNA503_01644_CID_000_002 -- We'll keep the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> here for now, but if you need to head back to Ishgard, you can use that standard to signal for an Ironworks airship.

TEXT_HEAVNA503_01644_CID_100_002 -- Don't worry─we charted a route safe enough for others to fly...unless that primal shows up. But what are the odds of that, eh?

TEXT_HEAVNA503_01644_CID_100_032 -- Imperial troops? Here? Well, hopefully that's the last of them. We'll keep an eye out for others.

TEXT_HEAVNA504_01645_CID_000_003 -- Imperial troops? Here? Well, hopefully that's the last of them. We'll keep our eyes open, either way.

TEXT_HEAVNA504_01645_CID_000_024 -- There you are! Did you see it!?

TEXT_HEAVNA504_01645_CID_000_025 -- It's that damned flying whale again! The imperials are after it!

TEXT_HEAVNA504_01645_CID_000_028 -- He's wounded!

TEXT_HEAVNA504_01645_CID_000_052 -- Now we're getting somewhere! Tell us, Chief Sonu: what exactly is this “Azys Lla”?

TEXT_HEAVNA504_01645_CID_000_055 -- And beyond ours...

TEXT_HEAVNA504_01645_CID_000_059 -- It'll take a lot more than imperial cannons to bring that beast down...

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_CID_000_005 -- Could we not just leave the key to the forbidden land in the island-eating whale's belly? I mean, I can think of worse places to keep it. ...No? I thought not.

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_CID_000_031 -- Gifts which he has taken to eating, yes. Technically within his rights, I suppose, if perhaps a little ungenerous. Gods, eh!? But what of you, Alphinaud? Did you learn aught of value?

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_CID_000_033 -- Skyfishing...?
My gods, that's it! Alphinaud, my boy, I could kiss you!

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_CID_000_034 -- From what we have observed, Bismarck is a creature of pure instinct, driven primarily by hunger. When wounded by the imperials, it fled─but not before devouring another island to restore its strength.

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_CID_000_035 -- What I propose is this: we tow a suitably appetizing island through the Sea of Clouds, in essence “fishing” for our flying whale.

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_CID_000_036 -- Once we draw Bismarck out of hiding, we shall use dragonkillers to fire grapnels into the beast's hide, and then reel it in close, enabling our resident eikon-slayer to engage it directly.

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_CID_000_038 -- Oh, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> won't fail. And if anything does go wrong, I'll be at the helm of the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, ready to tow <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> out of trouble. I wouldn't entrust a task like this to anyone else.

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_CID_000_040 -- Not at all, the more the merrier!

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_CID_100_040 -- Right, then─it seems the boys and I have a lot of work to do if the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> is to be ready for our fishing trip, while you two need to find me some bait! And not just any island, mind─I want a mouthful at most!

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_CID_000_041 -- Personally, I've seen enough of that flying feathered whale already...

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_CID_000_003 -- The boys and I can handle most of the preparations, but we'll need you to secure us a suitable island. Let me know when it's done!

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_CID_000_020 -- Our Ishgardian friends have furnished us with dragonkillers and ammunition, and I've taken the liberty of procuring a magitek field generator as well.

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_CID_000_021 -- Rest assured, we've chains to spare, every link forged by the manufactory's master craftsmen. If you've any lingering doubts as to their strength, know that they were originally intended to bind dragons─and were not found wanting.

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_CID_000_023 -- Then all that remains is to confirm the readiness of the poor buggers who'll actually be doing the fighting. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, let Wedge know when your party is assembled.

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_CID_000_026 -- We'll depart for the island once you've assembled your party. Let Wedge know when you're ready.

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_CID_000_042 -- Since we still don't know the extent of Bismarck's influence, I'd prefer to keep those not actively participating in the battle inside the ship. It would be a shame if one of us started chanting “The White! The White!” and stabbed you in the back, after all.

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_CID_000_060 -- In retrospect, we should probably have seen that coming. Still, you fought well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─better than that, in fact. Chin up, eh?

TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_CID_000_002 -- I know you're eager to get after the Heavens' Ward, but considering what we just put the old girl through, I'd say she's due a little tender loving care.
...Now, where did I put my hammer?

TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_CID_100_018 -- What the─!? Was that what I thought it was?

TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_CID_000_020 -- Thank the Twelve you're alive, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! When that battleship appeared and fired on the village, we feared the game was up for you and Alphinaud. What in the seven hells happened out there?

TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_CID_000_021 -- First the archbishop turns up with an Ascian in tow, and now the godsdamned <Emphasis>Emperor</Emphasis> pays us a visit!? What is this, a procession of notable bastards? Who's next? The Keeper of the Seventh <Emphasis>bloody</Emphasis> Gate!?

TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_CID_000_026 -- Speaking of which, if you're all ready to continue the chase, the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> is as well. Shall we?

TEXT_HEAVNA508_01649_CID_000_000 -- Lest you wonder, Wedge was able to calculate the heading indicated by the beam of light emitted by the key. If Azys Lla lies in that direction, we'll find it.

TEXT_HEAVNA508_01649_CID_000_001 -- The <Emphasis>Soleil</Emphasis> may have a lead on us, but she's no <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>. We'll catch them─you'll see!

TEXT_HEAVNA508_01649_CID_000_010 -- Ack! And we'd barely finished repairing the damage incurred during our skyfishing trip. On the other hand, any landing you can walk away from, as they say...

TEXT_HEAVNA508_01649_CID_000_011 -- I can only presume the <Emphasis>Soleil</Emphasis> passed through the barrier unscathed. That would certainly explain why the Vanu called it a key...

TEXT_HEAVNA601_01650_CID_000_003 -- For every day I spend in the sky, it feels as though I spend a week on the ground...

TEXT_HEAVNA601_01650_CID_000_031 -- I swear, wherever there's an Allagan ruin, there's trouble just waiting to happen. I suppose that's why they erected such damnably convoluted defenses around <Emphasis>everything</Emphasis>...

TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_CID_000_020 -- Ah, you're back! The preliminary work on the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> is more or less finished. Tell me you found a way to build the aetheric ram!

TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_CID_000_023 -- Ack, where are my manners? Put a toy like this in my hand, and I go off into my own world... Gods, it's good to see you! And bearing a gift besides─a very distracting one, if I might add! If I didn't know better, I'd think it was my nameday.
...But there will be time for tearful reunions later. I'll make a start on the tome right away. So long as I have a grasp of the fundamentals, I should be able to knock something together. Which leaves the small matter of the energy source...

TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_CID_000_028 -- Boys! Our friends have kindly provided all the ingredients. Let's see if we can't make something out of them!

TEXT_HEAVNA613_01662_CID_000_004 -- 

TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_CID_000_0020 -- Whew... I don't know about you, but I'm glad to be back on solid ground─even if said ground is floating in the sky.

TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_CID_000_0021 -- When that imperial battleship appeared, I honestly thought we were finished. And we would have been, had your friend not arrived when she did.

TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_CID_000_0027 -- She gave her life because she believed in us. We owe it to her to see our mission through.

TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_CID_100_0027 -- See that dome-like structure further in? Let's make our way there.

TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_CID_000_040 -- The isle's sentinels don't seem to frequent this area. We should be safe here.

TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_CID_000_041 -- Let's talk strategy, shall we?

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_000 -- First of all, in the interests of efficiency, I suggest we make this place our base camp. We can coordinate the search for the archbishop from here.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_002 -- Good. Now, unless I'm mistaken, this used to be an airship landing, and a major one at that. From what I know of Allagan design, there should be a terminal nearby that's linked to the isle's operational heart.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_003 -- If we can find such a terminal, we should be able to learn something of the archbishop's whereabouts. Let's split up and look for it.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_004 -- This terminal has long since ceased to function. Search for another.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_040 -- ...Nothing? Damn it. There's just this terminal, then, but it doesn't respond to anything I do. Any bright ideas, Wedge?

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_041 -- ...Wedge? He was here just a moment ago. Oh, don't tell me he's wandered off...

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_042 -- I'm sorry, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, but could you help me search for him? Absent-minded as he is, I worry that he's strayed beyond the landing area, and made friends with the local sentinels.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_043 -- I need you to help me search for Wedge. Absent-minded as he is, I worry that he's strayed beyond the landing area, and made friends with the local sentinels.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_051 -- Wedge! Are you all right!?

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_053 -- Fool of a Lalafell! What were you thinking, coming here on your own!? Death by overwork is one thing─death by <Emphasis>stupidity</Emphasis> quite another!

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_055 -- What is this? The wreck of a sentinel?

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_070 -- Hm. This isn't quite what I had in mind, but it might just serve.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_071 -- Wedge, bring the node this way, would you? There's something I'd like to try.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_072 -- Node! I need a status report on the facility!

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_075 -- Ah, here we are... Hmmm, not much of note. It appears someone recently reactivated “Helix,” which is this area.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_077 -- By the archbishop, I'd wager. I daresay he woke the place up when he used the Vanu's key.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_078 -- Are there any other people in the facility? If so, where?

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_079 -- Let's see here... On the “Flagship”─that's the central isle─I'm seeing positive readings within the Aetherochemical Research Facility and the Fractal Continuum...

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_080 -- And what have we here? Intruders detected in the Gamma Quadrant, defense system engaged.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_082 -- Hmmm, what might offer an indication? ...Ah! How about this: which area is currently consuming the most energy?

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_083 -- ...Somewhere called “Triad Control,” inside the research facility.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_085 -- It is, and I quote, “a regulation facility for the 'Warring Triad' test subjects.” And that's all it says. The rest of the information is only accessible to users with consular privileges.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_CID_000_088 -- That settles it, then. Let's find a way to cross over to the Flagship.

TEXT_HEAVNA703_01665_CID_000_007 -- Well, this node turned out to be rather more useful than I expected!

TEXT_HEAVNA703_01665_CID_000_013 -- Understood. We'll see that she's repaired and ready to fly. If anything happens, just let me know via linkpearl.

TEXT_HEAVNA703_01665_CID_000_017 -- Should you need to return to Ishgard for supplies, you can use that standard to signal for an Ironworks airship, just as before.

TEXT_HEAVNA703_01665_CID_000_018 -- When your business below is done, let our man at the airship landing know, and he'll ferry you back here to resume the mission.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_000_013 -- (-???-)<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!? I <Emphasis>thought</Emphasis> it was you!

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_000_014 -- What brings you to Saint Coinach's? Don't tell me─the Alliance has sent you on another realm-shaking, history-making mission to lay low an apparently insuperable foe, yes? <Emphasis>No</Emphasis>?

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_000_016 -- <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> has, has <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If>? Glad to have you aboard, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! You...don't have the faintest idea what you've volunteered for, do you? Very well, let us begin at the beginning.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_000_017 -- The Sons of Saint Coinach are tasked with unearthing the secrets of the long-fallen Allagan Empire, and this present endeavor aims to delve more deeply into the civilization's mysteries than ever before.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_000_018 -- ...Ah, but I know that look. In the event that you feel ill equipped to contribute much on the subject of Allagan archaeology, I invite you to recall your encounter with the Ultima Weapon.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_000_019 -- That mechanical monstrosity represented a feat of engineering far beyond aught Garlemald can presently achieve─Nero tol Scaeva simply awoke it. I mention this by way of a reminder that you have had what one might term...<Emphasis>extensive firsthand experience</Emphasis> with a notable Allagan relic. In short, you're practically an archaeologist.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_000_020 -- Now, to the core of the matter: here in Mor Dhona, there stands an entire Allagan structure which we have yet to investigate. I speak, of course, of the Crystal Tower.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_000_021 -- After witnessing the destructive capabilities of the Ultima Weapon, and the lesser moon, Dalamud, before it, it seems wise to treat any remnants from that era with the utmost caution. They must be analyzed, monitored, and─above all─kept from falling into the wrong hands.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_100_021 -- To put it plain: I have no wish to see another megalomaniacal legatus wield one of those weapons. It was this thought which first moved me to contact the Sons and propose that the tower be explored.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_100_022 -- For several millennia, the Crystal Tower remained hidden, buried deep underground. But, like so many other things that were better left undisturbed, the structure was freed from its stony prison by the great upheaval which accompanied the coming of the Seventh Umbral Era. It now stands revealed in all its splendor, a gleaming spear of crystal, pointed at the bosom of the heavens.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_100_023 -- We believe the tower to be the repository of much of the ancients' wisdom. Unfortunately, its entrance is guarded by formidable defenses, and we cannot so much as peep through the keyhole, much less set foot inside.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_101_023 -- These defenses take the form of statues, carved into the likeness of giant swordsmen. “The Eight Sentinels,” as the Sons are wont to call them, is the first barrier we must overcome.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_102_023 -- Why not simply fly over them in an airship, you ask? It's been tried before: any vessel that ventures too close to the tower is blasted out of the air. We either destroy those statues, or the front door is forever beyond our reach.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_CID_000_025 -- If I didn't know better, I'd say you had a taste for these deadly escapades! I look forward to working with you again.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_051 -- My thanks for sharing your knowings, Backrix. These Illuminati are indeed most hostile.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_100_051 -- Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> old friend! You haven't seen Y'shtola, have you?

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_052 -- ...Drained of all aether in a matter of mere <Emphasis>moons</Emphasis>? Seven hells! How much power does that thing need? <Emphasis>Too much</Emphasis>, plainly. Well, it sounds as if we have an urgent dismantling job on our hands.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_053 -- From what Backrix has been telling me, the Illuminati are the most likely culprits. They have the knowledge to summon a primal, and the requisite shortsightedness not to think better of it.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_054 -- “Fanatical” captures their philosophy nicely, I think─their goal being nothing less than sole ownership of all the world's technology. Needless to say, they're more than willing to kill anyone who stands between them and what they want.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_055 -- Quite how they managed to coax a primal into the hulk of a Sharlayan defense mechanism I don't know, but it looks like they've made themselves a tidy little fortress inside the colossus.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_056 -- We'll need to contend with them if we're to disable the thing. As for the task itself, simply destroying whatever serves as its engine should do the trick─assuming it is in fact mechanical. ...But before all that, we'll need to find a way in─through yet <Emphasis>another</Emphasis> bloody barrier.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_058 -- Roundrox? Sorry, who is...?

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_061 -- I'm sorry for interrupting, Roundrox, but I need to ask you a question. When the ground shook three years ago, did something come bobbing up to the river's surface?

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_063 -- So it wasn't the tremor that freed the colossus─it was the colossus which caused the tremor. And you are absolutely <Emphasis>certain</Emphasis> you saw it rise from the waters, young one?

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_064 -- Seven hells─I think someone tried and failed to summon it three years ago. But was it the Illuminati, or...?

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_066 -- Ah, just the goblin! Slowfix tells me you're his resident expert on the Illuminati. Pardon me a moment while I consult with my fellow uplander.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_100_066 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─if I may make a suggestion, I'll speak with Brayflox, and learn what I can of our opponents.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_067 -- In the meantime, could you investigate the colossus itself? Biggs and Wedge are near where its hand landed on the shore of the Thaliak. Join them, and see if you can't find a way inside the machine. Oh, and good luck with that barrier!

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_201 -- ...So the Illuminati have been announcing the way to enter the colossus all along? Strange. Well done for cracking the code, anyway.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_203 -- I had less success, sadly. I'm afraid Brayflox knows little more than we do about the Illuminati's plan or the primal.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_204 -- Come, come, things aren't as bad as all that. We've found a way inside the machine; we'll just have to learn about it as we go.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_205 -- It's only a massive mammet, after all. Stopping it should be as simple as destroying its core. If we send in a suitably intrepid team of surveyors, I don't see why we can't trace the machine's power back to the source via the struts and piping.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_206 -- And I know just the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> to lead the party. What say you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_208 -- You did as you promised, and you may do as you will now─but only so long as your treasure hunt doesn't endanger the mission.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_209 -- I'd join you if I could, but there's something I need to see to first. I'll leave Biggs and Wedge here in case of emergencies. Good luck, my friend!

TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_CID_000_501 -- Ah! There you are, old friend. I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever find you. Biggs's account left something to be desired, so I thought it best to see the interior with my own eyes.

TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_CID_000_503 -- Hm! A treasure hunter, through and through. Tell me, what exactly do you hope to find here?

TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_CID_000_507 -- A <Emphasis>walking</Emphasis> citadel? ...Seven hells! We're standing in it, aren't we!? The Illuminati's primal took its form from that idea! ...But I sense that none of this is news to you. You've read it, then, this <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis>?

TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_CID_000_512 -- ...And what exactly would the Illuminati do with all of this knowledge?

TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_CID_000_514 -- Bloody fanatics. Take a perfectly good idea and make it into an object of faith. What could possibly go wrong...?

TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_CID_000_515 -- I can well imagine how a people who have spent decades carrying their homes on their backs might crave a home that could carry them─how such a place could seem like a utopia.

TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_CID_000_516 -- But we're not talking about a machine here─we're talking about a <Emphasis>primal</Emphasis>. And primals will be the death of us all.
I trust you'll be ready when things come to a head, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_001 -- All present and correct, I see. Good. Something has been nagging at me for a while, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and I've finally realized what it is. It concerns the communications Wedge intercepted.

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_002 -- So, we know that the Illuminati have managed to establish a base inside the colossus, meaning they must also have found a way to pierce the magic barrier. Assuming that's the case, what need have they to use the only hatch which the barrier doesn't protect? And why go to the trouble of sending coded messages on how to unlock it?

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_100_002 -- The answer? Spies. I believe the Illuminati have an agent outside the colossus, most like in Idyllshire itself, who is using the hatch as a back door.

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_003 -- Now, this agent will know we've broken their code, and that the hatch is constantly watched, so he won't have been able to use it for some time. As such, he'll doubtless be desperate to reestablish contact with the inside.

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_100_003 -- And that's why I've cleared the area around the giant's hand. All we need do now is watch and wait...and follow whoever makes a dash for the hatch.

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_502 -- ...This is how you treat those who please you?

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_504 -- And what of those who don't fit your vision of perfection? How many must die to pay for your utopia!?

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_505 -- Don't you see? You summoned a godsdamned primal! It will devour the aether of every land you visit, until Hydaelyn and everything on it is dead!

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_507 -- Hells take you and your damned seeking!

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_509 -- So it's obey or die, then? Pah! The whole concept is grotesque!

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_511 -- Oh, so once upon a time, these Illuminati were starry-eyed philanthropists, is that it? And it was only after they got their hands on your perfect bloody codex that they turned into vicious killers. Tell me, was there any passage in particular that convinced them to abandon their last shred of empathy?

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_513 -- You think you can, or you know you can? And what of its location?

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_516 -- Ha! Clever girl! You've been measuring how far we've come from the start!

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_CID_000_517 -- All right, I propose we withdraw for the time being. I don't know what will happen when we breach the core, but I <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> know that we'll be better equipped to deal with it if we're well rested and ready for anything.

TEXT_HEAVNR105_02094_CID_000_503 -- Come, come, little one. Dry your tears.

TEXT_HEAVNR105_02094_CID_000_504 -- One thief─unconscious. We found him lurking near the edge of town─not far from your treasure, Roundrox.

TEXT_HEAVNR105_02094_CID_000_506 -- It was all Biggs, little one. He had a feeling a few soldiers might be lurking around, waiting to ambush us, and this is what we stumbled onto when we went to look.

TEXT_HEAVNR105_02094_CID_000_508 -- I wouldn't be so sure. Were I to guess, I'd say that the Illuminati believed something they wanted was hidden amongst Roundrox's pile of trinkets. Rather than waste time sorting through them, they decided to take the lot. But when they subsequently realized they didn't have what they were looking for, they crept back into town to wait for a chance to seize whatever it was they actually wanted.

TEXT_HEAVNR105_02094_CID_000_508 -- I wouldn't be so sure. Were I to guess, I'd say that the Illuminati believed something they wanted was hidden amongst Roundrox's pile of trinkets.

But when they subsequently realized they didn't have what they were looking for, they crept back into town to wait for a chance to seize whatever it was they actually wanted.

TEXT_HEAVNR105_02094_CID_000_514 -- Three years ago─when someone tried and failed to summon the primal...

TEXT_HEAVNR105_02094_CID_000_516 -- Only a fragment of the original? So that crystal must be the Illuminati's missing piece!

TEXT_HEAVNR105_02094_CID_000_517 -- We may have stopped their primal and taken their prize, but our foes are not about to admit defeat. They'll be back, and out for blood, like as not.

TEXT_HEAVNR105_02094_CID_000_518 -- But we've got you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─and I'm sure you'll be ready for the onslaught when it comes. Might I suggest you make merry till then?

TEXT_HEAVNY202_02115_CID_000_020 -- There you are, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. The <Emphasis>Enterprise Excelsior</Emphasis> is ready to depart whenever you are.

TEXT_HEAVNY202_02115_CID_000_021 -- ...Say again? Chief Sonu wants you to smash some gemstone against an aetheryte to dispel a barrier of storm clouds? I, uh...I don't even know where to begin...

TEXT_HEAVNY202_02115_CID_100_021 -- Bah, the hells with it. Maybe it'll bring us good luck. I'll rendezvous with you there.

TEXT_HEAVNY202_02115_CID_101_021 -- You know, you could just lie and say you did it.
...What? <sigh> Fine, we'll do it the hard way.

TEXT_HEAVNR201_02249_CID_000_412 -- And you are certain that steel monstrosity is to blame?

TEXT_HEAVNR201_02249_CID_000_414 -- Be that as it may, I'm afraid we have more pressing concerns. The Illuminati are up to something, and we mean to hit them before they can put whatever it is they're planning into action.

TEXT_HEAVNR201_02249_CID_000_417 -- ...I see. So, assuming I have understood correctly, you need only activate this Electrojammer of yours, and the Illuminati will be plunged into disarray, affording <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> friends ample opportunity to take them unawares? Very well. Proceed.

TEXT_HEAVNR201_02249_CID_000_423 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, old friend─it's time for your customary heroics! The Illuminati are likely still scrambling to work out what just happened. Before they do, I suggest you hop across the river and show them what for!

TEXT_HEAVNR205_02253_CID_000_700 -- Is that a heated debate, I hear!? Boys! You started without me! Now, what was that you were saying over the linkpearl? Something about running out of time?

TEXT_HEAVNR205_02253_CID_100_701 -- You can say that again! 

TEXT_HEAVNR205_02253_CID_000_703 -- Y'shtola─would you mind lending me your goggles for a moment? It can't hurt to have a second opinion.

TEXT_HEAVNR205_02253_CID_000_704 -- What in the seven hells...!? The aether pouring from the primal is flowing <Emphasis>backwards</Emphasis>...as if time were passing in reverse.

TEXT_HEAVNR205_02253_CID_000_708 -- Gods help us... If there is any truth to this, it won't matter how many cores we disable─the Illuminati will simply undo any damage we cause!

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_CID_100_012 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, Alphinaud! Ready to go? The others have stepped out onto the landing for a moment, lest you wonder. Nero <Emphasis>insisted</Emphasis> that he be allowed to inspect the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis> before boarding.

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_CID_100_014 -- Calm yourself, Alphinaud─your sister was adamant that he would never leave her sight. She and Yugiri are─ Ah, well here they are now.

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_CID_000_020 -- Right, I think that's everyone. Shall I set course for Carteneau?

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_CID_000_026 -- <Emphasis>All right</Emphasis>. While Alphinaud speaks with his colleagues, I shall fly the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis> over to Mor Dhona, and we can reconvene at the Rising Stones.

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_CID_000_029 -- Right. Everyone heading to Mor Dhona is welcome to travel aboard the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis>. I'll clear things with the girl at the counter here. Let her know when you're ready to leave.

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_CID_100_040 -- Not quite a door-to-door service, but I couldn't exactly land her in the Toll's main square...

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_CID_100_041 -- Shall we adjourn to the Rising Stones, then?

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_CID_000_035 -- We must be careful, old friend. The walking weapons of Allag were expressly designed to subdue primals, but men like Gaius will always seek to use them against mankind. It falls to us to ensure that Omega is never employed as a weapon of war. In the wrong hands, it would be...
It would be bad.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_CID_000_005 -- Oh, I think he's going to fit right in.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_CID_000_035 -- The rest of us will form the Carteneau expedition party. Nero and I will focus on rousing Omega, while <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, Yda, and our Doman friends take care of security.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_CID_000_036 -- The <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis> is by the lake just outside town. We'll leave as soon as everyone is ready.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_CID_000_060 -- We haven't far to go─with any luck, we'll be in Carteneau before Gosetsu graces the deck with his dinner.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_CID_000_061 -- Once there, however, we had best be on our guard. Given that Eline Roaille was still active when Omega was discovered, we can be sure that the Empire has long been aware of its existence. And if Nero deemed it the obvious solution to the threat posed by this new primal, it is not impossible that Garlemald might do the same.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_CID_000_062 -- Have your weapons ready and your wits about you. Something tells me we're flying into a fight.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_CID_000_065 -- I take it you're ready to make for the control room?

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_CID_000_080 -- I'm not sure why we lost contact with Omega, but I mean to find out. Let's be on our way.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_CID_000_110 -- One moment everything was functioning perfectly and the next it wasn't. It makes no sense. We need to see what happened for ourselves, and soon.

TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_020 -- Alphinaud looks like he has news for us. I almost dread to ask...

TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_071 -- You are too kind, Elder Seedseer. As I recall, we as good as demanded the right to try. But tell me: how did the battle unfold?

TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_072 -- We succeeded in waking Omega, aye, but we lost contact with the weapon shortly after it launched. From our position in the control room, we were blind to all that followed...

TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_080 -- Well, that explains a few things. I'll wager that “flash of light” coincided with our loss of contact...

TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_080 -- Well, that explains a few things. I'll wager that “flash of light” coincided with our loss of contact...

TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_081 -- Lest you wonder, we quickly reengaged Omega's stasis systems, so even if it <Emphasis>has</Emphasis> fallen into the Empire's lap, it will be of no use to them─save perhaps as a statue.

TEXT_HEAVNG104_02359_CID_000_100 -- If, as seems likely, we put Omega into stasis after─what did they call it? Ah, yes─after “Shinryu” was defeated, we should have little to fear from either one of them.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_053 -- ...An Illuminati spy. Sent by Quickthinx to observe our movements, like as not. Given the sizable disadvantage at which we find ourselves, we thought it best to relieve him of duty.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_054 -- He spent his final moments babbling about all of the Illuminati's deranged schemes. Claimed that once the final core was activated, and Alexander fully operational, the fortress would gain the power to travel through time─taking them along with it!

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_056 -- Aye, and that's not the half of it. According to him, the battle for history has already been won─and not by us. For the future is writ in the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis>, and we but play out our roles in it.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_060 -- I'm not one to look a gift coeurl in the mouth, but something about all of this doesn't sit right with me. She has been at Quickthinx's side─make that <Emphasis>on his bloody head</Emphasis>─every step of the way, and <Emphasis>now</Emphasis> she decides to betray her keepers? If the cat could speak our tongue, I would have a question or two for her─mayhap even three.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_060 -- I'm not one to look a gift coeurl in the mouth, but something about all of this doesn't sit right with me. She has been at Quickthinx's side─make that <Emphasis>on his bloody head</Emphasis>─every step of the way, and <Emphasis>now</Emphasis> she decides to betray her keepers? If the cat could speak our tongue, I would have a question or two for her─mayhap even three.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_061 -- ...Ugh. I can't believe I'm even considering this, but then it wouldn't be the strangest thing I've heard today.
You there! Cat! You're Shanoa, Quickthinx's little familiar, aren't you? Two mews for “yea,” one for “nay.”

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_065 -- Seven hells! I think the bloody furball might actually understand us. But that doesn't mean we can trust her. For all we know, she could be here to do her master's dirty work.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_069 -- Oh, this just gets better and better... Look, whatever is going on here, we're not like to find out by standing around talking. We need to delve deeper into that fortress.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_070 -- And as luck would have it, Wedge claims his latest invention will allow us to do just that. I've sent him and Biggs on ahead to the Makers' Quarter to perform their final tests. Meet them there when you are ready. I'll join you as soon as my own preparations are complete.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_400 -- All right! Time to deactivate the barrier!

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_401 -- The smoke is too thick! Can't see a damn thing! You'll have to press on alone!

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_700 -- Fine work, old friend! Thanks to you, we have our way in. Stay where you are─we're coming.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_701 -- But first─now that you're clear─we had best get that barrier back up before the big fellow gets restless. Wedge, ready the BBG-II and reactivate the barrier on my mark...mark!

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_702 -- Excellent timing, Y'shtola! <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> has done it─we have a clear path into the heart of the beast!

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_704 -- What, Mide? On the basis that she summoned the damn thing, you mean? I think you'd better explain.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_706 -- By creating a vast impassible aetheric membrane between the primal and the land from which it drinks, aye. Which is why the old witch had me place those infernal devices of hers in every nook and cranny of this place. Are you telling me they don't work?

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_708 -- All right, out with it, Mide. If there is anything you haven't told us, we need to hear it now. We are running out of options.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_715 -- Then our course is clear. If the old witch's magicks won't avail us, we shall just have to get inside and dismantle the core the old-fashioned way!

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_719 -- No. We press on. Lest we forget, controlling Alexander requires the codex, and the codex is but a useless piece of stone without the mind of the gobbie girl. If we can rescue Roundrox, Quickthinx will have no way to flip the hourglass.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_CID_000_721 -- ...Then it begins! I'll send word to our friends in Idyllshire. Biggs, Wedge, ready the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis>! <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, prepare for departure. Let Operation Rescue Roundrox commence!

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_CID_000_500 -- Excellent work, old friend! That platform is our shortcut to the heart of the machine. All seems quiet on our front, so─ Seven hells! We've got company!

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_CID_000_501 -- Ah, there you are, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! We were met by a small welcoming party, but it was nothing we couldn't handle. Biggs and Wedge just contacted me as well─they're headed here as we speak.

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_CID_000_503 -- So this is the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis>...

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_CID_000_510 -- Seven hells, has the girl gone mad!? Stop this, Roundrox! STOP, I say!

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_CID_000_601 -- Biggs! Wedge! Can you hear me? Roundrox has engaged Alexander's time-distortion mechanism. We're hurtling into the past!

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_CID_000_605 -- What in the seven hells...? Someone's taken control of the colossus! Hold tight─I think it's about to go berserk!

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_CID_000_703 -- So, when Mide and her friends attempted to summon Alexander three years ago, what they <Emphasis>actually</Emphasis> saw was <Emphasis>us</Emphasis> traveling back in time!? But that's... That's madness!

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_CID_000_902 -- You leave that to us, child. Wedge! Get Jessie on that linkpearl and tell her to bring the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis> around!

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_CID_000_903 -- Though I don't much care for the answer, we finally know the truth behind the events of that day three years past. The Illuminati masterminded the massacre and─through some ungodly trick of time─'twas <Emphasis>us</Emphasis> that brought them there to do the deed.

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_CID_000_501 -- There it is... The heart of the beast. Only now that I see it up close do I comprehend the true scale of the thing.

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_CID_000_502 -- To have reached this size in so short a space of time, the core must be taking in aether at a positively ungodly rate. I'd be willing to wager that it can regrow itself faster than we could ever hope to chip away at it.

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_CID_000_503 -- ...Which means we'll need to change tack. Hmm... The central control room houses everything required to operate the colossus. It's not inconceivable that it might offer us a way to regulate, or even shut off, the flow of aether to the core. Of course, any attempt to control Alexander is doomed to fail without the guidance of the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis>─and there is only one person alive who can access its secrets...

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_CID_000_510 -- What the─? You mean to say the book Quickthinx has been reading from all this time is <Emphasis>your journal</Emphasis>? The same journal that slipped from your hands when we traveled back in time?

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_CID_000_511 -- So <Emphasis>that's</Emphasis> how he was able to anticipate our every move! He's no prophet─just a gobbie with delusions of grandeur and a diary from the future!

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_CID_200_515 -- Now, now, Wedge. Taking out our frustrations on a mewling kitten won't get us any closer to dismantling the core. Getting back to the crux of the matter...

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_CID_000_516 -- Backrix. You said the journal ends right where you left off, yes? That it's nothing but blank pages from that point on?

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_CID_000_517 -- Do you hear that, everyone? Though Quickthinx would have us believe otherwise, the future─the future from here onward, that is─is still to be written. And I'll be damned if <Emphasis>we</Emphasis> won't be the ones to write it!

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_102 -- Seven hells! Now <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> was a bit too close for comfort. Is everyone all right!?

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_103 -- A colossus inside the colossus...? Look─I don't know what that thing was, but I'm pretty damn sure I know where it went─or, more accurately, <Emphasis>when</Emphasis>. If I'm not mistaken, what we're looking at is a localized distortion of time.

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_104 -- The only question is when our metal friend will reappear... Hm. Better not to wait, lest it catch us unawares. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─I need you to head into the distortion and dismantle that thing. We'll secure a path to Central Control while you do. Good luck!

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_200 -- I'm quite certain we just witnessed another manipulation of time, but by <Emphasis>whom</Emphasis>? With Roundrox gone and the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis> rendered useless, it can't very well be the Illuminati. Could Alexander have a will of its own?

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_201 -- At any rate, we stand ilms from the core─the very heart of a primal. Whatever the true nature of the entity that awaits you in there, you can be sure it'll be like no foe you've faced before. Godsspeed, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_300 -- You do not disappoint, old friend! The path to the control room is clear! Everyone─follow me!

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_305 -- What in the─!? The damn thing's responding to him!

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_310 -- Now, child!

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_312 -- Power stores are depleting rapidly. Without a steady supply of aether, it's only a matter of time before the whole thing grinds to a halt and fades away.

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_315 -- Hah! Sounds to me like you had a nice nap in a rubbish chute! But what matters is that you're safe. And with that, I think we can declare this operation a success.

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_501 -- Damn it all! Didn't we kill that bastard!?

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_503 -- <Emphasis>Betterbuilt</Emphasis>? Seven hells... That's not a mask─it's his face! He's more machina than goblin!

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_CID_000_509 -- It would seem Alexander has achieved what a simple fleshwound could not. Quickthinx's permanent...deactivation. Quite how and why is less clear. If I didn't know better, I would say the machine had a mind of its own.

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_CID_000_212 -- There you are, child! We were worried sick about you. What's that, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Is aught amiss?

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_CID_000_213 -- ...The codex no longer responds to her touch? Intriguing...if not entirely surprising. Were I to guess, I would hazard that it's because this experience has served to open her eyes.

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_CID_000_214 -- The <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis> was born from one man's all-consuming pursuit of perfection, its knowledge sealed off from any who harbored even a sliver of doubt as to the merits of the ideals it espoused.

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_CID_000_215 -- Quickthinx. Mide in her youth. Roundrox. Though their reasons might differ─arrogance, youthful idealism, childish innocence─none thought to question the words within, and so the codex opened itself to them. But now Roundrox has seen with her own eyes what blind devotion to ideals can bring.

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_CID_000_217 -- Aye. It's all well and good to dream of building something perfect, but sooner or later you have to stop dreaming and start doing─hammering it together by your own hand, with your own blood, sweat, and tears.

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_CID_000_218 -- In so doing, you are forced to confront your own failings, and deal with your frustration at the world's unfortunate habit of falling below expectations. Hells, there may come a time when you just want to tear the whole bloody thing apart and start again. But more often than not, you emerge from it all with something you can hold on to, and carry with you into the future. And <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> will do a damn sight more for you than any starry-eyed ideal.

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_CID_000_222 -- Frozen in a single moment until the end of time. That's a fate I'd not wish on anyone...

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_CID_000_224 -- Well, look who it is! You have a real knack for turning up underfoot, don't you?

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_CID_000_225 -- I am reminded of the apparent ease with which this little coeurl seemed to slip in and out of the colossus. Were it not for the small matter of time having stopped in there, I'd send her in with Roundrox's glowstone without a moment's hesitation.

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_CID_000_229 -- Giving a stone to a cat, in hopes of delivering it to two souls trapped in time─now I think we've seen everything. Do you think those two will ever be free of that place?

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_CID_000_233 -- I contacted Biggs and Wedge to let them know that they can call off the search. Needless to say, they were relieved to hear that Roundrox is safe. There was also a matter they were looking to discuss with you. They said they'd be waiting for you back at the Shortstop.

TEXT_STMBDA101_02446_CID_000_168 -- Hah! Of all the castra in all the world, you walk into mine.

TEXT_STMBDA101_02446_CID_000_170 -- A certain missing Allagan weapon and draconic primal. Omega and─Shinryu, I think the shinobi called it? Anyway, we've been studying their trail of destruction, hoping it might lead us somewhere─which it has singularly failed to do.

TEXT_STMBDA101_02446_CID_000_172 -- Even so, it bears repeating that we engaged the stasis systems. Assuming the command was received and executed successfully, the weapon will be of no use to them. Assuming. We should hurry up and find it, regardless.

TEXT_STMBDA102_02447_CID_000_025 -- 

TEXT_STMBDA706_02553_CID_900_020 -- ...Hm. This is indeed the work of either Shinryu or Omega.

TEXT_STMBDA706_02553_CID_900_021 -- ...And since there is undeniably <Emphasis>something</Emphasis> down there radiating a massive amount of energy...which cannot very well be the late viceroy's lapdragon... Yes, I think we have our suspect.

TEXT_STMBDA706_02553_CID_900_022 -- Well. This is a mess of our own making, so it falls to us to clean it up. It won't be easy...but is it ever?

TEXT_STMBDA706_02553_CID_900_024 -- I...er... Financial considerations notwithstanding, you have to admit there is an unquantifiable benefit in giving our people the opportunity to study such advanced technology─

TEXT_STMBDA706_02553_CID_900_027 -- ...You didn't.

TEXT_STMBDA706_02553_CID_900_029 -- Oh. Oh no. Absolutely not. This is not happening.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_020 -- Go on! <Emphasis>Suggest something</Emphasis>! And I'll be sure to do the exact bloody opposite!

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_041 -- How many times do I have to tell you!? You will play <Emphasis>no part</Emphasis> in this investigation!

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_042 -- Your motives were dubious from the first, and nothing you have done since has served to make them any clearer.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_043 -- Out of necessity, I agreed to take part in Omega's activation, but that will be the extent of our cooperation!

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_046 -- Then I trust you'll thrive elsewhere when I encourage you to piss off!

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_047 -- I will not have him on our roster, Jessie─never mind anywhere near our work. His employment is to be terminated, effective immediately!

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_050 -- I don't believe this... You claim my <Emphasis>wholly justified</Emphasis> ventures represent an “unsustainable risk to the Ironworks”─and then pay him a sultan's ransom in advance!? <Emphasis>Him</Emphasis>!? Give me strength...!

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_058 -- Forgive me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It was not my intent to embroil you in this mess. I didn't even know you were here. Seeing as you are, though...I cannot deny that I would be glad to have you on board.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_059 -- The fact is, we are no closer to understanding the true extent of Omega's powers, and even if it was damaged during its encounter with Shinryu, it seems highly doubtful that we will be able to disable it unaided.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_060 -- We have got as far as identifying its likely resting place, but I for one would feel a lot more confident about surveying the area with you around to deal with any unexpected surprises. Might I persuade you to lend us a hand once more, old friend?

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_063 -- What? But that could only mean─

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_064 -- Evacuate the site. I shall handle this matter personally.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_065 -- Biggs, Wedge, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─I need you with me at the Yawn, to the south of here. That's where we believe Omega came to rest.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_066 -- Jessie─hold the fort while I'm gone. And, if possible, continue surveillance from a safe distance.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_069 -- Oh no. I'm not letting you out of my sight. But before you fill the room with maniacal laughter, I want you to remember something: when you collected your inexplicably lavish fee, the Ironworks' creed became <Emphasis>your</Emphasis> creed. That's “Freedom through Technology,” in case you've forgotten─not “Supremacy through Allagan Ingenuity.” Breach this contract and I will have my ponze of flesh.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_100 -- What in the seven hells is going on here?

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_109 -- Apparently not. It passed straight through me...as if it were some sort of illusion.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_120 -- I've no idea what it is, but it doesn't seem to pose any immediate threat.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_146 -- Uh...<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Aren't you going to introduce us to your knowledgeable little dragon friend?

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_147 -- What, <Emphasis>the</Emphasis> Midgardsormr─who fought and fell at the Battle of Silvertear Skies!?

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_152 -- But now Midgardsormr tells us that it's not even of our world.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_189 -- Well...I doubt any of us imagined things would come to this, but the Father of Dragons has given his assurance. Let us take our investigation into the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_190 -- I have already apprised Jessie of our intent and instructed her to have our engineers on standby.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_191 -- Since we have no way of knowing what awaits us in there, I need you to be ready for anything. Are you?

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_192 -- Let us begin!

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_206 -- Experiment? If you want our participation, you'll have to tell us a little more than that.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_215 -- Looks like some manner of tower...or egg.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_220 -- Combat capabilities? You mean you want us to fight?

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_227 -- Alpha, was it? My colleagues and I are minded to participate in Omega's experiment. Will you transfer your authorization to us?

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_250 -- That's our goal, the Deltascape, if I'm not mistaken. What do you think is waiting for us in there?

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_265 -- Before we turn our thoughts to the Deltascape, I suggest we set up a base of operations here.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_300 -- It's somewhat cobbled together, but this should suffice as a base of operations.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_CID_000_301 -- Take heart, old friend. Though every step we take seems to raise more questions, we will wade through this mire of mysteries eventually, of that I have no doubt.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_030 -- Right then, what to do next...

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_031 -- We know that Omega is conducting tests to determine the strongest being.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_032 -- But we do not know its ultimate purpose, nor even its exact whereabouts.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_034 -- Well, Alpha certainly seems keen. Though it might be best if you left the fighting to others, little one.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_035 -- That is, of course, assuming “others” are willing? What say you, old friend?

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_039 -- Hmph. 'Tis a pity none of us speaks chocobo. As I recall, though, we are supposed to have Alpha transfer his authorization to us prior to engaging in combat.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_040 -- In which case, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, you'll need him to accompany you into the Deltascape. See to your preparations, and proceed whenever you are ready.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_050 -- At this point, we're doing little more than fumbling in the dark. Take care in there, you hear?

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_100 -- Well done, my friend! We were lucky enough to witness every moment of your struggle via the Deltascape's various surveillance devices. I daresay we had a better view than you did.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_107 -- So in the name of self-improvement, it wants to make a new playmate... And it chose to undertake the task here to avoid outside interference, yes?

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_110 -- If I understand you correctly, the moment Omega's grand experiment is complete, it will give birth to a creature mightier even than Shinryu and then proceed to fight it.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_111 -- Gods help us all if a battle of that scale should come to pass. The powers unleashed would be enough to bring about another calamity.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_118 -- That would be a great help. Nero and I can handle things at this end.

TEXT_STMBDR103_02930_CID_000_010 -- We must pray that Biggs and Wedge are able to repair the stasis system.

TEXT_STMBDR103_02930_CID_000_011 -- If they can't, we will have little choice but to see Omega's experiment all the way to its bitter conclusion. A tall order, I concede...and one that would require you to prove yourself the “mightiest being in creation.”

TEXT_STMBDR103_02930_CID_000_012 -- Well, we must hope for the best and plan for the worst, which in this case means pressing on with the tests. Are you ready for the next foray?

TEXT_STMBDR103_02930_CID_000_020 -- Hmm. The data does indeed suggest some capacity for gravitational manipulation. Even so...I would be wary of setting much store by Nero's toys.

TEXT_STMBDR103_02930_CID_000_055 -- Good to have you back safe and sound. I see Nero's toy didn't...let you down.

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_010 -- I doubt we'll be hearing from Biggs and Wedge for a while yet. Shall we push on here in the meantime?

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_011 -- Reliable as ever. Without further ado, then, let us move things along.

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_012 -- According to the analysis, your next opponent, Delta III, is a being named Halicarnassus.

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_014 -- What's this? You know of her?

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_018 -- ...You mean to tell me that Omega is populating its grand experiment with <Emphasis>fictional characters</Emphasis>?

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_027 -- Quiet, Nero. We adults are thinking.

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_028 -- ...But mayhap now is not the time. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> said <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> was ready to continue, and so am I. Let's deal with Halicarnassus.

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_030 -- My musings will keep. For now, we should concentrate on defeating Halicarnassus.

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_070 -- I'm glad you're safe, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. For a moment there, I feared you might croak.

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_071 -- Forgive me. You deserve better than that. Thanks to you, we are but one victory away from clearing the Deltascape. Take as much rest as you need, old friend. You've earned it.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_010 -- The next battle is with Subject Delta IV─this test world's final resident.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_016 -- Tell me something, Nero. What happens at the end of the tale?

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_018 -- I expected exactly that, which is precisely what troubled me earlier. If the heroes won, why did Omega not make them its test subjects?

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_019 -- If it seeks to determine the strongest being, why would it bother with those who were defeated?

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_020 -- One moment─linkpearl. ...Ah, Biggs. At the control room, are you? What news?

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_021 -- ...I see. Very well. I'll tell the others. You two take care over there.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_022 -- Sorry for the interruption. That was Biggs.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_023 -- He reports that the stasis system shows every sign of being engaged, despite the fact that it clearly isn't.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_024 -- It can only be a malfunction. While we were able to turn it off, it would seem the reverse is not possible.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_026 -- Hard to say. They tell me it seems complex even by Allagan standards. While they may be able to fix it, there's no telling how long it might take.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_028 -- Nero has the right of it. At this time, focusing on Exdeath would seem to be our only recourse.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_030 -- The void... 'Tis not unlike the nothingness that Emperor Xande sought in the Crystal Tower.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_031 -- To desire nothingness is to deny life, yet life seeks to endure─to perpetuate itself. It is the nature of all creation. Be it reality or fantasy, man shall ever fight to survive.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_032 -- Biggs and Wedge had a further message for you. They said they were sorry they couldn't resolve things at their end, and wished you luck in the coming battle. I do too, old friend─unless I'm mistaken, this is like to be the toughest test yet.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_100 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Thank the gods you're safe! When the shell around this place began to crack, we feared the worst!

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_105 -- And with that, we've taken a significant step towards solving the mystery that is Omega. It hasn't been easy, but all in all, I'd say things were proceeding rather smoothly.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_106 -- We couldn't have done it without you, old friend. Come, let us return to reality and enjoy what rest we can.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_130 -- Ahhh, it feels good to be back on solid ground. Thank you again, old friend.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_131 -- You did well too, Alpha, fearlessly going into battle whenever you were called upon. We're glad to have you with us. Speaking of which, are you...comfortable joining us out here?

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_CID_000_132 -- I'll take that as a yes. Well then, at the risk of obeying Omega's orders, I suggest we permit ourselves a moment's respite─ Ah. But mayhap I should take this opportunity to compile the results of our investigation thus far. No rest for the righteous...

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_010 -- Right then, let's head back to Rhalgr's Reach. Jessie will want to know exactly what we've been up to.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_025 -- I've apprised Jessie of our travails, but you may want to let her know you've returned. She claims to have been quite worried...

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_044 -- I did...after a fashion. Though I may have exercised some...executive discretion.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_049 -- Oh, you can't be─ What in the seven hells has gotten into you!?
Listen─if I've caused you any distress, I apologize, but I will <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> have you comment on our guest's <Emphasis>marketability</Emphasis>!

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_050 -- Where are Biggs and Wedge? Shouldn't they be back by now?

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_052 -- I don't like the sound of this. Though we have all the necessary permissions, the area is technically a theater of war, and one littered with unknown Allagan artifacts to boot. Something may well have befallen them.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_053 -- We'd best take the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis> and go and find them.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_058 -- Want to come along, eh? It's probably for the best. If we leave you here, Jessie is liable to take a mold of you.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_059 -- Right, let's get moving. I'll bring the airship to Gridania. Wait for me at the landing.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_080 -- Looks like we're all here. Let's make haste to the Carteneau Flats.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_100 -- Go on ahead to the control room, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. We'll follow as soon as we've moored the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis>.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_110 -- Everything in order? Good. Let's make haste to the Carteneau Flats.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_150 -- Seven hells! Biggs, Wedge!

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_151 -- Are you all right!? Answer me!

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_156 -- Omega!? You set that thing upon them!?

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_171 -- ...'Twould seem we have much to ponder. But first things first: we must tend to our friends. Quickly─help me carry them.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_194 -- The worst is passed, but they still drift in and out of consciousness. They'll remain in the conjurers' care for a time.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_196 -- Bah! Gods strike me down for a fool! I should have been more mindful of the dangers! I should never have─

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_198 -- But is this truly any better? All of mankind is being held to ransom! And as the one who activated Omega, I bear the responsibility!

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_204 -- With little prospect of restoring the stasis system, I'm afraid we have no recourse but to continue participating in Omega's tests.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_205 -- Assuming Midgardsormr has the right of it, we face a legion of foes from history, both real and imagined.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_206 -- Though I may not be the one who charges into the fray, I shall fight beside you as best I know how. That said...it will inevitably fall to you to administer the coup de grâce, old friend, so please...for Biggs and Wedge, and all of us─don't lose!

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_210 -- Before they were attacked, Biggs and Wedge discovered a tomestone.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_211 -- I shall examine its contents and make the information available on the terminal over there as I extract it. Feel free to refer to it whenever the occasion arises.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_CID_000_212 -- There's no telling when Omega will summon us, but we must all see that we are ready when it does. Fear not, old friend. We'll get through it together...somehow or other.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_085 -- Allow me, Lina.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_086 -- I've known Jenomis since we were students at the Magitek Academy. When I heard his daughter was in Kugane looking to enlist the aid of an adventurer, I felt compelled to give her your name. Sorry for not announcing myself sooner, old friend.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_087 -- Jenomis and I were from different worlds, but that only served to fuel our friendship. Many were the nights we would prattle on into the wee small hours─warm flagons of peated ale numbing our minds to the other's naive ideologies. Yet, no matter where our conversation began, it would invariably end with him telling me how he was going to change the Empire from the inside out. The troupe was to be his path into the people's hearts.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_088 -- Even after the Empire forced him from his home, Jenomis never gave up hope that his work might change the world.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_090 -- What I am trying to say─rather poorly, I concede─is that not all Garleans are hewn from the same stone.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_091 -- Just as there are those who pledge their lives to the Empire, and would never think to question the authority of its leaders, there are those like Alma's father and myself whose love for their country does not blind them to its flaws.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_092 -- Still...try selling that sack of sun flour to an Ala Mhigan or a Doman who has watched his family consumed in the flames of a magitek reaper.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_105 -- Indeed.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_110 -- Now that you understand the nature of the task, perhaps Alma could provide some insight as to where we might begin our search.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_208 -- One which begins and ends with Jenomis becoming lost in the very legend he sought to lay bare.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_209 -- Even as far back as our Academy days, Ivalice had Jenomis firmly in its grasp. He flatly refused to believe the story was just a faerie tale.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_210 -- And so, when he was finally driven out of Garlemald, it was only natural that he should choose this of all places as his refuge─was it not, Alma?

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_212 -- Poor Dalmasca... The kingdom prospered in relative isolation for countless generations...until the Empire came calling.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_216 -- Ivalician legend tells of crystals bequeathed by the gods unto those who would be kings. It is during his quest to gather auracite that young Delita rises to prominence.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_217 -- I must have heard the tale a thousand times from my nursemaid. But that is all it ever was─a tale.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_227 -- So good of you to join us, Ramza. Allow me to introduce─

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_231 -- Your sister is right, Ramza. As for my good friend here, your mistrust is ill-placed. I will personally vouch for <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> character. In all the time I have known <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her, she<Else/>him, he</If> has never once let anything as insignificant as race or creed color <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> judgment. You are lucky to have <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_233 -- You know why. Until this affair with Omega is resolved, my hands are tied. It pains me to refuse you and your sister, but it pains me far more to leave Jenomis to his fate... I am sorry.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_236 -- The Empire turned Rabanastre into a death trap. You were a fool to set foot there without a proper escort.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_CID_000_240 -- Then, Alma, I shall leave you and your brother in <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s capable hands. <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> has ever repaid my trust with interest. You would do well to grant <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> yours.

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_CID_000_303 -- You would have done the same for me, Jenomis. Besides, it was <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> here who went to all the trouble. If anyone deserves your thanks, it's <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>.

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_CID_000_304 -- ...So, if I understand correctly, you're saying auracite does <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> work to facilitate the possession of a living host by an eikon, as was assumed to be the case with Ysayle and the archbishop...

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_CID_000_305 -- ...but rather absorbs the host's aether─its very <Emphasis>soul</Emphasis>─and somehow transforms it before returning it to the host's body.

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_CID_000_306 -- If that is the case, our Sharlayan allies will need to be informed immediately.

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_CID_000_307 -- But I suppose the real question here is...did you find what you came looking for?

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_CID_000_310 -- Then...

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_CID_000_315 -- Go on...

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_CID_000_325 -- Forbidden chronicles? A secret family legacy? Not that I doubt you, Jenomis, but how do you expect to convince people of all of this when well-nigh every soul in the realm believes Ivalice to be nothing but a bedtime story?

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_CID_000_101 -- To be frank, summoning Mikoto was more Y'shtola's idea. I simply came along to see what light she could shed on this mystery.

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_CID_000_107 -- ...Hmph. While that explanation may elicit admiring nods from your professors at the academy, it will earn you only blank looks here. Take a deep breath and try again─this time in a language those of us <Emphasis>without</Emphasis> the Echo might comprehend.

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_CID_000_109 -- Apologies will see us no nearer to an answer. A simpler explanation will.

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_CID_000_111 -- Try again.

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_CID_000_114 -- What my studious young friend is <Emphasis>trying</Emphasis> to say is that the Otius takes one's deepest fantasies and makes them reality.

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_CID_000_120 -- If the Durai Papers are accurate, Argath was a weak and petty noble who believed that his blood entitled him to power. The auracite took that belief and twisted it into the abomination we─uh, <Emphasis><Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/></Emphasis> put to the sword.

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_CID_000_124 -- To paraphrase: “It is not the weapon that kills, but the one who wields it”?

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_CID_100_124 -- Now where have I heard that before...

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_CID_000_125 -- Oh, yes. It was Emperor Galvus's justification for taking the marvels of magitek and applying them to the manufacture of arms. Where, after all, was the harm if it allowed him to “bring order” to the Three Great Continents?

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_CID_000_128 -- Now <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> is an interesting question─the answer to which I look forward to hearing. Regrettably, I have pressing matters to attend to elsewhere. Fear not, however: Mikoto's insight will prove far more beneficial than anything I might accidentally contribute. Good day to you all.

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_CID_000_128 -- Now <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> is an interesting question─the answer to which I look forward to hearing. Regrettably, I have pressing matters to attend to elsewhere. Fear not, however: Mikoto's insight will prove far more beneficial than anything I might accidentally contribute. Good day to you all.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_003 -- Our colleagues on the ground have reported the appearance of “mysterious floating structures” inside the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_004 -- If you recall, we were investigating a similar anomaly when Alpha and Alte Roite made their appearance.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_008 -- ...He says with eyes aflame. For once, I wish you <Emphasis>were</Emphasis> being sarcastic.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_009 -- Anyway─the energy surge. Based on our previous experience, it seems highly probable that it is our signal to rejoin the fray.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_010 -- Needless to say, it is an invitation we cannot refuse─not when the alternative is Omega unleashing its creations on Eorzea.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_011 -- Well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Are you ready to answer the call?

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_013 -- Yes, of course. We'll just have to struggle on without them for the time being.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_014 -- Don't worry─Nero and I will see to it that you receive all the support you need. Defeat is not an option!

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_018 -- A custom-made Ironworks uniform! Oh, you do look smart, I must say.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_020 -- How very thoughtful of you, Jessie. And there I was thinking you were just sizing him up for a new range of merchandise.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_060 -- Hmph. How inviting.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_061 -- I'm ready when you are, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Say the word, and we'll take the plunge.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_062 -- Right, then. Into the Yawn we go!

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_070 -- Well...the rift seems much as it did before.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_074 -- Omega.
'Twould seem your experiment continued in our absence.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_086 -- Ah, those are some nice...cards? Which means... One moment. Card...game...play...<Emphasis>play</Emphasis>! You mean to play a part in proceedings this time?

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_087 -- Of course that's what you meant. Well, we do have authorization to fight in this area of the rift, so I suppose there's nothing to stop you from joining us. Welcome aboard, Alpha!

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_110 -- That seems to be the end of them...and of the path, as well.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_112 -- In between scrambling to stay out of the way of Nero's new toy, I found myself wondering about that card you used, Alpha. Care to explain?

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_140 -- ...That should do it. Our new base of operations is up and running!

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_141 -- Now, what I'd <Emphasis>really</Emphasis> like to do is delve a little deeper into Omega's past. But as our dragon seems disinclined to indulge my curiosity, we had best focus on the task at hand.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_000_142 -- Let's get on with conquering the occupants of this “Sigmascape,” shall we?

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_BATTLETALK_000_001 -- There's no avoiding this “evaluation.”
Let's watch our step though, eh?

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_BATTLETALK_000_002 -- One of Omega's monitors...
On your mark, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_BATTLETALK_000_003 -- Bah, of course it's shielded!
Leave the barrier to me.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_BATTLETALK_000_005 -- That's that taken care of...

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_BATTLETALK_000_007 -- ...Let's just move along, shall we?

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_BATTLETALK_000_008 -- ...<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Alpha?
They're not here!

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_BATTLETALK_000_009 -- We've arrived on different platforms...
Come, Nero, we have to find them!

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_BATTLETALK_000_012 -- You just <Emphasis>had</Emphasis> to bemoan our “poor welcome,” didn't you...

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_BATTLETALK_000_017 -- Over there! A flash of light!
It could be <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and the others.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_BATTLETALK_000_019 -- Was that one of your cards!?
Good work, Alpha!

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_CID_BATTLETALK_000_021 -- It would appear so.
Let's finish this!

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_020 -- Before you cross the threshold, we should take a moment to discuss where we stand.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_021 -- <Emphasis>That</Emphasis> is the test world you need to conquer. The Sigmascape.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_023 -- And we currently have no idea what it might signify. My first instinct is to dive straight into our analysis.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_024 -- ...The problem being that without a reference point from within the Sigmascape to start from, we'll have no way of knowing if we're even analyzing the correct data.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_025 -- Which means you'll just have to go in blind. Hardly the best way to enter into a fight, but needs must and all that. Are you up for the challenge?

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_026 -- Can I ask you to join <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>, Alpha? We seem to be fine out here, but <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> will need your authorization if <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If>'s to do battle inside the test world.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_030 -- Say the word to Alpha when you're ready. Again, I wish I had more to tell you, but I'm sure you'll manage somehow. You always do.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_080 -- Thank the gods you're fast on your feet. When I first saw you'd be facing a train of all things, I assumed I was hallucinating.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_081 -- But with that oddness behind us, we can be fully certain we have the right set of data for the Sigmascape.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_082 -- From what we've been able to determine, this is a recreation of a devastated world.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_083 -- Unfortunately, we have not found any clues as to its origin. We came across several familiar terms─“Doma” included─but the arc of history is inconsistent with our own.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_CID_000_084 -- Given that Omega draws from realms which could be fictional or even other-dimensional, we can only guess at the source upon which the Sigmascape is based. But if it <Emphasis>was</Emphasis> fictional, it seems safe to assume that the author had a bad experience with a train.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_020 -- I expect you're still recovering from your last fight, but we should probably go over the details of your next opponent all the same.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_021 -- According to our research, you'll be pitted against a foe known as “Chadarnook.” Not a train this time, but some manner of animated <Emphasis>painting</Emphasis>...

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_022 -- To be perfectly clear, the name refers more to the evil spirit that's taken up residence within the picture─but the “picture” part will be key to our strategy.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_023 -- To that end, Nero has thrown together a little something I thought might be useful...

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_026 -- I seem to recall you <Emphasis>insisting</Emphasis> on constructing it yourself. Still, credit where credit's due─well done.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_032 -- Now listen here, Nero─I apologize for the damn kettle, but this has nothing to do with my upbringing!

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_040 -- Oh, sorry, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─little distracted there. Talk to Alpha when you're ready, and we can see about crossing this Chadarnook character off the list.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_080 -- Welcome back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I was on the edge of my stool watching you attempt to paint whilst fighting, but you soon seemed to get the hang of it!

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_081 -- I'm glad our makeshift solution worked as intended.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_084 -- ...One moment.
Aye, this is Garlond.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_085 -- ...That's great news! And wh─
...Oh, they did, did they? ...Understood, we'll meet them out there.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_086 -- That was Jessie. Apparently, Biggs and Wedge considered themselves well enough to pay us a visit. They're on their way to the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_087 -- Fancy a brief jaunt to the surface?

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_089 -- Fine. Just the three of us, then.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_090 -- Look at the two of you, up and about already! You gave us quite a scare...

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_111 -- Nonsense. After all you've been through, how could we not come running? Speaking of which...should you even be walking?

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_114 -- Ah, yes...the little jobs. It does seem that you two have spoiled me. I only recently learned that the kettle does not, in fact, fill itself... But we're muddling along somehow.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_115 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> has been a pillar of strength, as always, Alpha has proven to be a stalwart companion, and Nero...Nero has been invaluable and insufferable in equal measure.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_CID_000_116 -- As for the test subjects themselves, they're certainly formidable, but Omega's experiment hasn't broken us yet. So go home. Heal. And don't come back until you've fully recovered.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_030 -- Thank you for joining me up there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I know it meant a lot to Biggs and Wedge.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_041 -- Everything all right, Nero? You look a bit green around the gills.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_043 -- Really? Well, it wasn't my doing.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_047 -- ...Fair enough.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_048 -- Right, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─your next foe is known simply as the “Guardian.” Unlike that ordeal with Chadarnook, this battle promises to be relatively straightforward. Courage and steel should be enough to win you the day.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_050 -- The file I found on the Guardian says it was a weapon employed in the defense of an empire's capital city. That should give you some idea of the extent of its capabilities.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_100 -- Congratulations, old friend. Judging by the lack of smoking holes, I'd say you have a natural talent for avoiding laser beams. And this is what passes for a straightforward battle in here...

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_101 -- Phantom trains, possessed pictures, and now this magitek-like machine...
Assuming it was real, the realm the Sigmascape is based on must have been highly advanced in both the arcane and the mechanical arts.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_102 -- 'Tis truly a pity we cannot identify the test world's origin. Imagine how much we might have learned from such a civilization had we encountered it under different circumstances.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_CID_000_103 -- But now is not the time for such idle thoughts. The next battle will be the last for this world, and Nero should have a strategy to share with us by now...

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_000 -- Nero still seems unwell. How much of that coffee did he drink?

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_021 -- ...We've put together a profile of your next opponent.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_022 -- You've encountered some fantastical foes in here, but this time you'll have the novel experience of fighting an actual person. His name is “Kefka”...and he's a jester.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_023 -- According to the data, his preferred mode of fooling didn't just bring the house down, but the whole world.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_024 -- Apparently, he found comedy in the tragedies of others, and condemned countless thousands to death for his own amusement.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_028 -- You've been working on a solution, yes? Will it be enough?

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_034 -- How confident are you of this strategy?

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_037 -- ...I'm afraid he's right. I'll lend you all the support I can from this side.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_038 -- Make what preparations you need, and head into the Sigmascape. We can't let this jester have the last laugh!

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_050 -- Let's see this through, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. One battle at a time!

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_080 -- ...That's it, isn't it? <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If>'s won!

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_083 -- Come on! We should go and find <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_084 -- Nero!?

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_085 -- Talk to me, man! Are you hurt!?

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_087 -- Omega...
Damn it! We should never have left you alone. Not after what happened to Biggs and Wedge.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_090 -- All right, Nero, save your strength. I'll fetch <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and Alpha, and then we can get out of here.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_120 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Alpha! I need your help. It's Nero, he's─

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_121 -- ...'Twould seem we all have a tale to share. But not here. Come on, we're leaving!

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_153 -- Not good. It seems one of Omega's nastier minions paid him a visit in our absence. He's putting on a brave face, but having seen his injuries, I'm surprised he kept going for as long as he did.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_154 -- The chirurgeon's confined him to bed. Even should Omega extend its next “invitation,” Nero won't be coming with us.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_155 -- ...Midgardsormr is taking a lengthy nap now, isn't he? And it won't be long before our base camp is lost to the rift again...

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_157 -- I appreciate the offer, Jessie. And I may yet take you up on it...when the time comes.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_158 -- But let's not make any decisions just yet. I have a lot of thinking to do─about what's happened, and about what lies ahead.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_165 -- Well that got a smile out of him. We may not understand what he says, but I think we can understand how he feels.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_166 -- Right! Much as I'd like to stay and chat, we all have work to do. Sooner or later, we're going to have to face Omega itself, and we've all seen what it's capable of.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_CID_000_167 -- We need to be stronger. We need to be ready when Omega calls on us again. Let's make sure that we are.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_036 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Why am I not surprised that you're here already?

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_037 -- So this is the machine... At a glance, it doesn't appear to be of Garlean make.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_038 -- The young fellow there─I take it he's the owner?

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_039 -- And Noctis doesn't seem to know anything about Eorzea, you say? Peculiar...

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_040 -- Might he have lost his memories like I did?

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_043 -- I will be honest with you: this is technology I am unfamiliar with. I can't make any promises, but I will try my best.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_045 -- Never you mind that. To be able to work on a unique machine such as this is its own reward.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_047 -- Oh, and <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I trust you also heard about the mechanical soldiers.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_048 -- We're tasked with investigating them as well. By all accounts, they appear to be simply men, albeit armored head to toe and bearing advanced firearms. What betrays them is the unnatural efficiency with which they move.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_050 -- Em-tees?

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_053 -- That's quite an unusual tale, but then again I'm in the presence of unusual technology. I have no reason to doubt your words. You may have inadvertently activated a teleportation device and been sent to our world.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_054 -- At any rate, you seem to be acquainted with these mechanical soldiers. Perhaps you could investigate in our stead? They were most recently sighted near the Unholy Heir, not far to the east of here.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_056 -- W-Wait!

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_057 -- It wouldn't do to leave our visitor to wander a strange land alone. Could you accompany him, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Rest assured I'll tend to the Regalia in the meantime.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_058 -- Go on and follow Noctis, my friend. Rest assured I'll tend to the Regalia in the meantime.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_100_070 -- So, how fared you? Were you able to find the mechanical soldiers?

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_110_070 -- You <Emphasis>fought</Emphasis> them!? So the rumors were true...

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_120_070 -- That being the case, I would very much like to examine the technology with my own eyes.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_130_070 -- I have a favor to ask, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. The next time you encounter these soldiers, could you salvage their parts?

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_071 -- Don't worry, she's in a safe place. A reporter came sniffing about while you were away, so I decided to move her to the Dispatch Yard that we might carry out the repairs undisturbed.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_071 -- Don't worry, she's in a safe place. A reporter came sniffing about while you were away, so I decided to move her to the Dispatch Yard that we might carry out the repairs undisturbed.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_072 -- I'm pleased to say I was able to identify the problem, and I believe it can be fixed. However, it may take some time to fashion the replacement part.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_CID_000_094 -- I'll begin working on the replacement part for the Regalia, but it will take a while. Feel free to go about your own business in the meantime.

TEXT_FESBKC003_03160_CID_000_072 -- Apologies for the delay!

TEXT_FESBKC003_03160_CID_000_073 -- She's unlike anything I've seen before, so it took me a while to get acquainted, but the Regalia is as good as new.

TEXT_FESBKC003_03160_CID_000_091 -- I saw her too. It seemed to me she was waiting for Noctis. Guiding him. I can only assume they share a deep bond.

TEXT_FESBKC003_03160_CID_000_093 -- Perhaps so...and perhaps not. The sole person who could've enlightened us has vanished into the light.

TEXT_FESBKC003_03160_CID_100_096 -- A strangely charismatic young man, was Noctis... In the end, we never learned the circumstances of his coming here.

TEXT_FESBKC003_03160_CID_200_096 -- But if he has things he must do back home, as that Garuda-like being said, perhaps this was a trial that he had to overcome along his journey.

TEXT_FESBKC003_03160_CID_000_097 -- At any rate, old friend, I believe our work here is done. Wherever the long road may lead him, may Noctis ever ride in the light of the Crystal.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_021 -- It sounds like you've been through the mill. You should have called me.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_022 -- Though I must confess, tracking down missing souls isn't exactly within my field of expertise.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_025 -- <Emphasis>Please</Emphasis>─“revolutionary” is a term best reserved for my work. I am but an imperial defector who thought to aid another imperial defector.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_026 -- Whatever Master Garlond says, I am humbled to find myself in such distinguished company.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_027 -- Speaking of distinguished company, we heard from Raubahn that you ran into an old friend in the Burn. Is it true? Gaius still lives?

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_029 -- And he claimed to have severed ties with the Empire to hunt Ascians, did he?

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_030 -- Hmph. After his humbling at the Praetorium, one would think he'd have the good sense to stay dead.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_031 -- Should we meet again, I shall be sure to tell him so.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_035 -- For all the Empire's many crimes, even I did not suspect. Had I known, I would have left a lot sooner.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_036 -- But that is in the past. Here in the present, we must apply ourselves to the problem of how the Empire's ambitions may be thwarted, not only in Eorzea, but in the Far East as well.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_037 -- The Ironworks will spare no effort to achieve that end. Seiryu's Wall was a good start, but we can do more─and we will. We'll show them what it means to achieve “Freedom through Technology”!

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_040 -- Ah yes. The inevitable messenger. I knew it wouldn't be long before duty called you away.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_041 -- Time no doubt being of the essence, could I tempt you to a ride aboard the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis>? If there's a faster way to Raubahn's side, I will personally apologize to the commander for keeping him waiting.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_050 -- I swear, every time you board my airship, you seem to be barreling headlong into danger. And every time, you somehow contrive to emerge victorious. Which, of course, is an admirable skill.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_051 -- But no one is invincible, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Not even you. So please, take care of yourself out there.

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_CID_000_053 -- My colleagues and I have been tasked with evacuating casualties by air. See that you aren't among them, eh?

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_CID_000_167 -- Likely one similar to Omega.

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_CID_000_169 -- Long enough. I am here to deliver the item Mikoto requested.

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_CID_000_171 -- A moogle? And trust that he won't tear open the package and show it to some random adventurer? No, this was far too important.

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_CID_000_185 -- Before boarding the shuttle here I was stopped by a Bangaa on the docks. He asked me if I knew a <Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight> and bid I deliver <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> a message.

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_CID_000_186 -- I told him he was welcome to accompany me to the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis> so that he might deliver that message himself, but the man refused.

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_CID_000_187 -- Mikoto. I saw this device crafted to your exact specifications, but cannot guarantee that it will function as intended, seeing as I had nary a subject to test it on.

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_CID_000_189 -- Your confidence in my craftsmanship is flattering, but you sell yourself too short, my dear. Here's to your success. Good day!

TEXT_STMBDI303_03189_CID_000_314 -- Then you'll have your work cut out for you, my friend. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> has enough battles under <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> belt to fill at least three tomes, if not four.

TEXT_STMBDI303_03189_CID_000_316 -- And <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> tale is far from over, isn't it?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_022 -- Sorry I'm late! Was a little too focused on my work, and lost all sense of time...

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_024 -- Good, then you know that Omega is likely ready to continue with its tests. Shall we go and knock on the door?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_026 -- And what of Midgardsormr? Still taking his nap, is he?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_028 -- No, Jessie, I need your talents elsewhere. There's a half-built device in the workshop that I need you to finish putting together.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_029 -- I've drawn up the design, and completed the core mechanisms─the final assembly should pose no problem for an engineer of your abilities.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_032 -- Right, it's back to the rift for us! Let's finish these experiments, and bring the fight to Omega itself!

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_050 -- Are you ready, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_054 -- Aye, there's no room for hesitation. We press on, come what may.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_055 -- Come now, we're in this together. And if you'll just indulge me a little longer, I do have something of a plan...

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_056 -- What about you, Alpha? All set to go?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_058 -- That's the spirit! Let's dive right in, shall we?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_060 -- We're missing some test worlds. Omega's experiments must be nearing an end.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_065 -- ...We've come to the last round of testing, then. And should we win this battle? Are we to finally face you in combat?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_071 -- ...What do you mean by that?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_073 -- Even so, Alpha is a valued companion. And if he wishes to continue on with us, I've no intention of leaving him behind.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_086 -- ...Tell me something, Omega. This ability of yours to generate matter was not originally intended for creating other life-forms, was it?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_089 -- I disagree with you there. As an engineer, I would advise against using such technology for purposes outside its design.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_090 -- From the very start, you've been making the same mistake. Even the powerful subjects of your test worlds were made crippled and incomplete.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_091 -- It is <Emphasis>conviction</Emphasis> which drove these villains to terrible greatness; the same limitless conviction which allowed “weakling” heroes to overcome them.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_092 -- ...Do you not understand? Then we will never lose to your creations─no matter how much stronger they should be according to your soulless calculations!

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_093 -- Come, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Let's be on our way. You, too, Alpha.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_107 -- Into the rift we go!

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_110 -- I have our base camp up and running. You can dive into the final test world whenever you wish.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_111 -- As for the world's inhabitant, Omega has generously provided us with a basic profile.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_112 -- Your opponent's name is “Chaos.” The first heroes defeated this evil in a conflict that took place so long ago I'm having trouble separating myth from history.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_113 -- ...Unless of course, this is an entity from another reality, as were the denizens of the Sigmascape. In which case, it may be pointless to even attempt to confirm the details.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_114 -- What is certain, however, is that this Chaos stands triumphant over a roster of truly monstrous test subjects. It promises to be a grueling battle, but one which will open the gate to fighting Omega itself!

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_115 -- Alpha, you and I will need to provide support for <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Will you be my assistant?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_116 -- ...You're bothered by what Omega said earlier? You think you're responsible for dragging us into this mess?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_117 -- Trust me when I say this is not your fault. We were the ones who awakened Omega, and we're the ones who need to deal with the consequences.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_119 -- By the way, do you still have that card you used to boil water in the kettle?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_120 -- It's been brought to my attention that I'm a spoiled blue blood who can't even refill a pot without constant reminders. If you could take charge of that, then it would be most helpful.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_122 -- 'Tis inconvenient without Midgardsormr here to translate his chirping...

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_123 -- Still, the best medicine for his worries is for you to win this next contest. Let's show him we're on top of things, eh?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_130 -- I wonder what Nero would have to say about this Chaos fellow. Ancient technology is his specialty after all, and by default he's learned a thing or two about the mythology and history of bygone eras.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_157 -- (-Cid-)Omega, wait!

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_157 -- (-Cid-)Omega, wait!

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_158 -- (-Cid-)You can't force <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> to fight two battles back-to-back! <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> needs time to regain <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> strength.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_172 -- (-Cid's Voice-)<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I'm right here. I don't think you can see me, but I'm standing next to Alpha.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_CID_000_172 -- (-Cid's Voice-)<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I'm right here. I don't think you can see me, but I'm standing next to Alpha.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_010 -- My apologies. 'Twas not my intention to undermine the gravity of the situation with this...diversion.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_011 -- I'd noticed the kettle was boiled, and thought some tea would soothe my nerves. I poured myself a cup, and was halfway through drinking it before I realized my hand─not to mention the rest of me─had turned invisible.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_012 -- I understand the situation is unsettling, but I assure you I can still work unimpeded! Now, we had best discuss how to approach─

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_013 -- I... Oh. It seems to have worn off.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_015 -- Now, now, you're not to blame. I did ask you to fill the kettle, after all.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_016 -- And I'd forgotten what Nero had said about your card producing water with, uh, unexpected properties. Although it seems the effects were rather different this time...

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_017 -- In any case, 'twas pleasant to have a distraction from our greater woes, however brief. We'll set the rest of the water aside for now, and decide what to do with it later.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_017 -- In any case, 'twas pleasant to have a distraction from our greater woes, however brief. We'll set the rest of the water aside for now, and decide what to do with it later.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_018 -- Right, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. We need to talk about your forthcoming contest with Midgardsormr.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_019 -- Watching through the monitor, I could see that this wyrm appeared different to the one we know.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_020 -- From everything we've heard thus far, it seems that Omega and Midgardsormr both hail from different stars─two distant worlds at war with one another.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_021 -- As a result of that conflict, the wyrm was forced to gather his offspring and leave his home behind. And after evading Omega's pursuit over the course of an unimaginable journey, the Father of Dragons arrived here on our world.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_022 -- I'm assuming the entity you're to face is a younger, more vital Midgardsormr─just as he was when Omega first encountered him, thousands of years in the past. A formidable foe, indeed...

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_026 -- Aye. Hopefully Omega's “imperfect” data will contain a flaw we can exploit...

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_027 -- Wait, you've fought against Midgardsormr before!? ...But, yes, I think I see your concern. 'Twould be unwise to treat this as the same opponent, considering how different they might possibly be.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_028 -- It certainly doesn't help matters that Omega's little surprise isn't registered as an official test subject. I can't even use the terminals to search for the most basic information.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_029 -- With that in mind, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I have a proposal: I wish to leave the completion of this “supplemental stage” entirely in your heroic hands.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_030 -- Rather than twiddle my thumbs whilst you prepare to contend with the dragon, I mean instead to work on a strategy for our inevitable confrontation with Omega.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_031 -- And then, my friend, we will put a stop to this mad machine once and for all!

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_032 -- I'm glad we're in agreement. I'll ready my tools and you ready yours─you've a wyrm to slay!

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_040 -- Watch yourself in there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. The underlying data may be imperfect, but I recall Omega saying something about the battle ending only when one of you is dead. Expect no quarter and give none.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_060 -- Another stunning victory, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I felt the breath catch in my throat on more than one occasion!

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_061 -- ...Yet even as I watched the battle rage, I was struck by an idle thought. Did you notice the resemblance between Midgardsormr and Shinryu?

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_062 -- Unlike most primals, Shinryu's form had no basis in any system of belief. I've heard the theory that the summoner was simply influenced by the majesty and power of the elder primal Bahamut.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_063 -- But now, I'm beginning to think there might be another explanation─that the primal took its shape from the ancestor of all dragons on Hydaelyn.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_064 -- The widely held concept of how a dragon appears has, for centuries upon centuries, been rooted in depictions of Midgardsormr. The summoner may not have even sought to imitate him specifically.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_065 -- Subconscious thoughts and memories alone could have guided the similarity. Not that I have any way of confirming this theory, of course...

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_066 -- Nevertheless, 'tis interesting that Shinryu's summoning should lead us to awakening Omega. A strange twist of fate, when you consider the machine's connection to Midgardsormr.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_CID_000_067 -- Well, whatever else destiny has in store, you've already bested the opponent that Omega itself failed to overcome. A feat worthy of celebration, I'd say!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_010 -- Your move, Omega...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_016 -- ...This is it, then.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_017 -- Omega's power might seem overwhelming, but trust in old Cid! I have a fair idea of where its weakness lies.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_017 -- Omega's power might seem overwhelming, but trust in old Cid! I have a fair idea of where its weakness lies.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_018 -- And I've been working on something to exploit that vulnerability─I just need a little more time to prepare.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_019 -- First things first, we make a few adjustments here...like so...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_020 -- Ah, Alpha. Do you have any of those tricks and tools left over?

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_021 -- I want us to have as many options as possible, so let's lay our cards on the table...as it were.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_022 -- What do we have here? Some sort of gem... A couple of stones...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_023 -- And one single card. This makes things bigger, does it? Or is it smaller...?

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_024 -- Right. 'Twas foolish of me to even ask. We'd best leave you in charge of when and how to use your special tools.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_025 -- Ah yes, I almost forgot...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_030 -- Here, you should carry this as well. I've filled an empty bottle with the “invisibility water” from the kettle.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_031 -- It might just prove useful in the right situation.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_032 -- Listen to me, Alpha. Up until now, Omega has poked and prodded us from one mad experiment to the next, and honestly, we have no idea of what might happen in there.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_033 -- But between us, I believe we have the knowledge and the skills to prevail. If you see a chance to make a difference, I want you to take it. All you need is faith in yourself...and a little courage to see it through.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_034 -- Right, Jessie should have that device put together by now. Let's head outside, shall we?

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_040 -- I'll head straight back to Rhalgr's Reach and collect my new toy.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_041 -- I do still need to run through a final inspection, so feel free to rest in town in the meantime. We'll discuss strategy the moment I'm finished!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_061 -- Nero. They let you out of bed, did they?

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_064 -- ...Aye. All the available evidence supports such a theory. 'Tis likely an intrinsic weakness that even Omega itself cannot fully compensate for.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_065 -- Yet be that as it may, I imagine it can still shrug off shocks generated by ordinary means. We'll need to hit it with a truly gargantuan blast of energy...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_067 -- When my father was establishing a connection between the transmitter and Dalamud, he invented a method for accumulating and converting energy on a vast scale.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_068 -- Too vast, as it turned out. But the technology which leveled an entire town may be exactly the tool we need for the task at hand.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_069 -- I've made my own improvements, and triple-checked the calculations. On parchment, the idea is sound. And Jessie has done a fine job assembling the parts.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_071 -- ...I don't know. The device should give us the edge we need, 'tis just...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_072 -- Whenever I look at it, I'm taken back to those dark days after the incident.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_072 -- Whenever I look at it, I'm taken back to those dark days after the incident.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_073 -- I remember bodies, melted by searing heat. I remember the bereaved, and feel the weight of their silent accusations. I remember the Empire's remorseless response.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_074 -- We turned outwards in search of answers, but the inventions we created to ensure our future were used instead to destroy lives. To wage war.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_075 -- And that's why I fled. I came to Eorzea, and swore to only employ technology for benevolent ends.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_076 -- ...But naught is ever so straightforward. Every connection I have forged with the people of this realm reminds me of that fact.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_077 -- Often the act of living itself is a never-ending struggle against a world determined to oppose you.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_078 -- You can have the best of intentions, and still cause hurt to yourself or others. But 'tis in confronting these wounds that we learn the better path. How to grasp those moments of true contentment...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_080 -- Mayhap I am. I had no such hesitation when I was a student─it was all bright and shiny innovation on the double, and later consequences be damned.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_081 -- Now, though... I don't mind thinking through the outcomes, and taking the time to produce just one rigorously tested and carefully designed invention.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_082 -- 'Tis a reflection, I think, of just how much there is in this world I care about now aside from myself.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_086 -- ...I suppose I must.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_087 -- Although 'tis hardly fair to compare my youth to Omega's solitary existence. I always had the second-best student in class pushing me to excel.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_088 -- I seem to recall a twinge of irritation any time he would outscore me on an exam...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_100 -- First Alpha, and now you. Come to check on my progress, have you?

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_101 -- Well, I'm happy to report that everything is set and ready to go! Once you're finished with restocking and repairing or whatever it is you adventurers do, then we can head back to the rift and confirm our strategy.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_120 -- Apologies for the delay, but I think you'll agree the Ironworks' latest invention was worth the wait.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_121 -- This is the control module for something I've dubbed the “Omega Jammer.” It will allow you to generate a colossal burst of lightning at any point of your choosing.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_122 -- The effect won't disable Omega itself, of course, but it should be strong enough to knock out its armaments.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_123 -- I'll remain here and operate the main body of the device. I want to do everything in my power as an engineer to ensure that you emerge the victor. It all comes down to this!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_130 -- You can use the jammer's lightning bursts to incapacitate Omega's weaponry. A veteran like you should have no trouble turning that advantage into victory!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_200 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_201 -- By the gods, you've done it! You defeated Omega. We've won...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_210 -- What in the─? The rift!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_213 -- Omega, wait! There is nothing outside this rift but empty space! We'll be cast out into the void!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_218 -- We're being drawn away... Run, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Run!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_238 -- (-Memory of Cid-)All you need is faith in yourself...and a little courage to see it through...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_238 -- (-Memory of Cid-)All you need is faith in yourself...and a little courage to see it through...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_246 -- Our thanks, Alpha. That was some marathon!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_247 -- Now...
Who was saying our feathered companion here was “obsolete”?

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_248 -- He put his tools to work even as the rift began to collapse─shrank us down, and turned us invisible, all so he could bring you a little surprise.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_249 -- But he had to keep it quiet, or you'd realize we'd survived. He had to trust that we were still clinging on, even as he ran through that endless, freezing void...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_250 -- You wanted to test us, Omega...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_100_250 -- So let the experiment begin!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_270 -- Alpha should be fine with a little rest. I'll make sure he stays safe on the edge of the platform, so no holding back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_271 -- Give Omega a beating it won't recover from!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_304 -- Omega. The anomaly you see in us; the answer you search for...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_305 -- It is our heart. Our spirit. The intangible strength of one's soul. It is not a quality that can be measured or acquired through any amount of analytical combat.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_306 -- Instead of fighting against us, you might have learned more by standing <Emphasis>with</Emphasis> us. Just as Alpha did.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_311 -- ...Nay, Omega. I'm afraid it doesn't work like that.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_312 -- 'Twas a long, lonely path you traveled to arrive here.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_313 -- To return across that vast distance alone... Anyone with a spirit to break would find the journey more difficult, not less so. 

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_316 -- ...The rift! It's destabilizing!

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_317 -- Gods take me for a fool! I hadn't planned past defeating Omega...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_319 -- Wedge!? And Biggs is with him!
...On the back of a huge dragon.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_330 -- Uh...Hraesvelgr, wasn't it? Our thanks. You pulled us out of a tight spot indeed.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_332 -- Ah... So, Midgardsormr has been watching over us.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_333 -- I would dare give thanks to him, as well. His intervention allowed us to continue our battle, and forever remove the threat of Omega from this world. From all worlds...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_370 -- Well, I can add “being rescued by a great wyrm” to the list of things I didn't expect to happen today.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_CID_000_371 -- It was fortunate Hraesvelgr agreed to come for us. We had to defeat Omega at any cost, of course, but I much prefer being alive to celebrate the deed!

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_000 -- It's finally over...

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_040 -- Poor Jessie. Her nerves must be worn thin after all that...

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_064 -- Aye, all of its creations vanished along with the rift itself. With Omega defeated, we averted that particular catastrophe before it began.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_065 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> struck the killing blow, of course, but we never would have made it to that point without everyone's hard work and support.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_066 -- Once again, I am sincerely grateful to be surrounded by such wonderful colleagues.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_069 -- How much indeed...

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_070 -- ...All of it. When it comes to a threat of Omega's magnitude, we have a duty to reassure our allies that the world is not coming to an end. And the best way to do that is to report every last detail.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_072 -- Hah, I doubt anyone outside our particular circle would even believe the tale. Experiments taking place in a rift between dimensions? Facing off against villains recreated from history and legend? Battling godlike beings from other worlds?

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_073 -- And even assuming some ambitious fellow schemed to build an Omega of his own...

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_074 -- The technology required is as far beyond our reach as that terrible weapon's home star. A distant dream.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_077 -- Thank you, Jessie, I'll leave things in your capable─

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_081 -- ...Aye. I should probably head over to the infirmary right away.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_082 -- Meanwhile, you should take a well-earned rest. I don't think there's a way to properly reward you for all you've accomplished, but I'll see what we can do. 

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_121 -- Nero's not here!?

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_123 -- Recuperation? His wounds must be troubling him more than he let on...

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_125 -- What's this? A receipt for payment?

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_128 -- ......

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_129 -- Find him! I want everyone searching for Nero right now! EVERYONE!!!

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_250 -- Sorry to keep you waiting! My desk was covered in paperwork, but I've managed to clear away the most pressing matters.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_251 -- Now then, Alpha. I hear your heart's set on a journey of some kind?

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_252 -- I just want to be sure, but...you aren't leaving because you think you tricked us into the rift, or because you're Omega's creation or anything like that, are you?

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_253 -- I would have stopped you if that was the case. Pure curiosity, on the other hand, is something I like to encourage.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_254 -- Exploring, interacting with the world...I think the experience will be good for him.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_255 -- Despite Omega's power, its potential to learn was hobbled by hostile directives. Alpha, on the other hand, is free to grow as he pleases.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_256 -- Very well, Alpha. As the chief engineer of Garlond Ironworks, I hereby grant you unlimited leave to pursue “personal research.”

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_257 -- Travel far and wide, and take in everything these lands have to offer. But do come back when you're ready─I'd hate to lose such a valuable employee.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_267 -- Fair journey to you, Alpha! Take care!

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_269 -- Something amiss?

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_270 -- That's strange. The Echo never allowed you to understand him before.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_271 -- This is just a theory mind you, but...
Assuming the absence of a soul is what prevented you from “hearing” Alpha's voice in the first place, then does it not follow that the reason you hear it now is─

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_272 -- Aye, a little miracle. And it explains his sudden urge to travel!

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_CID_000_273 -- For a newborn soul, this world is brimming with unseen wonders!

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_301 -- Well, well. Gaius van Baelsar. We meet again.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_302 -- Come to see how your precious Weapon project has been proceeding in your absence, have you?

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_304 -- Any idea who this Milisandia is? An imperial crony of his, perhaps?

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_305 -- One of the orphans...

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_306 -- Gaius always did have an eye for talent and a mind to nurture it. In fact, Livia sas Junius was another protégé of his.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_307 -- He even took me under his wing when my father became obsessed with the Meteor project. It's strange that I felt closer to Gaius than my own flesh and blood.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_308 -- Then, my father and countless others lost their lives in the Bozja incident. Although he was acting under Emperor Solus's orders, he masterminded the whole thing.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_308 -- Then, my father and countless others lost their lives in the Bozja incident. Although he was acting under Emperor Solus's orders, he masterminded the whole thing.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_309 -- I'd begged him to reconsider, to put an end to this madness, but my words fell on deaf ears. That's when I turned to Gaius for support, but he was as much a pawn of the Emperor as my father, and refused to intervene. And when my turn came to serve, I defected and fled to Eorzea.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_310 -- I blamed Gaius as much as any of them, perhaps even more, for the barbaric acts carried out in the name of conquest. But when we met at the Praetorium, all the hatred that had been festering inside me seemed to fade away, and I remembered the man I once respected.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_311 -- To think the dreaded Black Wolf was a mere plaything of the Ascians, who left him broken and disgraced, having sent thousands of his men to early graves. It's more than most could bear. And now the lives of the children he raised hang in the balance.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_312 -- Any personal grievances I have with Gaius can wait. I'd best gather what information I can on the Ruby Weapon, but I'll be back as soon as possible.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_351 -- My engineers are still in the field, but there's something I thought you should know right away.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_352 -- It's about the pilot. I'm not sure how to tell you this, but...

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_354 -- Death would have been a kindness... In all my years, I've never seen such a perversion of science and nature.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_355 -- Her body was fused with the Ruby Weapon's core! Those last moments must have been spent in pure agony as her very life's essence was drained from her.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_359 -- From what I gather, it sounds as if data based on Nael's combat capabilities was used to override the pilot's consciousness after she was fused with the core.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_360 -- If this technology is perfected and the Empire begins implanting the memories of renowned warriors such as the White Raven into its soldiers, the Alliance won't stand a chance.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_365 -- While it may bear some similarities, we won't know for certain until we've analyzed the wreckage of the Ruby Weapon.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_CID_000_368 -- That's what I'm trying to determine. There is one possibility I'd like to explore, but I'll need to carry out a more thorough investigation first.

TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_CID_000_277 -- No, please! Lord Varis... Nooo!

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_061 -- It's hard to believe this place was, until recently, occupied by the Garleans. Doma has a long way to go before it regains its former glory, but they're off to a good start.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_062 -- So I've heard. If the Bozjans wish to follow the Domans' lead, I plan to do what I can to help them.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_063 -- In fact, I've already spoken to Lord Hien and agreed to divert part of the Ironworks' resources to assist in Doma's reconstruction.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_064 -- The offer seemed to have taken him by surprise, but I assured him that in addition to the Ironworks' commitment to freedom through technology, I have my own reasons to reverse the destruction wrought by the Empire.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_065 -- While it's true that I eventually defected, I played no small part in the development of magitek now used by their military.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_066 -- <sigh> Sometimes it's the threads you can't see that have the strongest ties. Would that I could cut them.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_070 -- Our talks were focused mainly on the reconstruction, as we thought it best to wait for your arrival to discuss how I might help the Bozjans.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_075 -- Even so, not a day goes by that I don't think about the part I played in the atrocities they committed.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_080 -- <sigh> If I could have made my father see reason, there would have been no Bozja incident.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_080 -- <sigh> If I could have made my father see reason, there would have been no Bozja incident.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_081 -- ...But I was powerless to stop him.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_082 -- Yes, you're right. There's a time for wallowing in self-pity and a time for action. I plan to do whatever I can for the Bozjan Resistance, but they're up against the IVth Legion...

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_083 -- If they're to stand a chance, their allies here in the East won't be enough. They're going to need all the help they can muster.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_084 -- I'm not entirely sure what part I'll have to play in all this, and I doubt anything I do now will be enough to atone for my past mistakes.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_085 -- But if it means throwing a spanner in the Empire's works, then count me in.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_101 -- All right. Just promise me you'll be careful in there.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_161 -- No... No, this is wrong. Emperor Solus couldn't have been there.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_162 -- No, please! Lord Varis... Nooo!

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_170 -- That was...always your greatest strength... Instilling in others the courage to rise up... The courage to fight for what's right.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_200 -- This...isn't right, either. Emperor...Lord Varis... He wasn't there. The Academy was given full charge of the project.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_202 -- Well if it isn't Varis, then who in the hells is it? What could I possibly have to hide from myself?

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_203 -- So it was you who pulled the trigger... Father.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_205 -- No...it can't be.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_208 -- Then in all likelihood, it wasn't an accident.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_208 -- Then in all likelihood, it wasn't an accident.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_209 -- And so the truth finally comes to light.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_250 -- Bahamut's thrall, and no one was the wiser. Not even your own son...

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_253 -- I'm just glad I could help.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_260 -- Come now, I'm the one who should apologize to you. After all my father and the Empire did, even if not all of their own volition, their crimes will never be forgotten.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_261 -- I'd hazard even victory over the Empire won't be enough to ease such pain. And even now that I know the truth behind the Bozja incident, all it's done is make me question the choices that led me here to this moment.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_261 -- I'd hazard even victory over the Empire won't be enough to ease such pain. And even now that I know the truth behind the Bozja incident, all it's done is make me question the choices that led me here to this moment.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_262 -- But regardless of the past, we have to keep pressing forward, one step at a time. For freedom.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_264 -- Cheer up, Bajsaljen. If we live long enough, perhaps we'll be the ones to pen them.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_265 -- You say the crystal focus is no longer responsive?

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_268 -- I thought perhaps the Alliance could use it to extract information from some of their less cooperative Garlean captives, but nothing's ever that easy, is it?

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_269 -- I'm afraid aetherology is beyond the scope of my expertise, so I'll leave the rest to you. If you need anything, don't hesitate to call for me.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_271 -- Well, I'd better head back. I've a mountain of work waiting for me.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_CID_000_275 -- Of course. If I run into any aether-related problems, you'll be the first to know.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_054 -- Glad you could make it, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I'm sure you're as anxious as anyone to hear what we've uncovered.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_055 -- Our early hypotheses were proven correct. The Garleans have designed a system whereby a pilot's consciousness can be forcibly supplanted with data based on the memories and experience of another.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_057 -- Precisely, and we learned how this was made possible when we opened the cockpit. The monitors were still operational, and among the messages displayed, one particular phrase caught my attention: “synthetic auracite system.”

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_059 -- Well, the core of the Ultima Weapon was referred to as the Heart of Sabik by the Ascians. We believe it to have been a type of auracite.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_060 -- I can't say much for the synthetic sort at this stage, but I've encountered real auracite before. It was extremely potent, perhaps equal in power to the Heart of Sabik.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_061 -- It's unclear whether the Garleans' simulacrum possesses the same properties as genuine auracite, but I intend to follow this avenue of inquiry to see where it leads.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_063 -- The link didn't occur to Gaius at first, but he later told me of devices fitted to the magitek armor of the Empire's high-ranking officers.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_064 -- There is reason to believe they were designed to emulate the soul crystals used throughout Eorzea.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_066 -- There is also the question of whether this system even functions as intended.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_067 -- From what we've seen, we can assume they were successful in gathering combat data of those wearing armor equipped with the device. If the comparison with soul crystals is valid, perhaps this data was transferred via aether.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_068 -- However, it seems that it extracted not only memories relating to combat, but the soldier's very essence. As you saw, the pilot succumbed entirely to the will of van Darnus.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_069 -- Though this is merely supposition, it's possible that being fused with the Ruby Weapon's core accelerated the process and caused the deceased legatus to manifest in corporeal form.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_071 -- It's hard to say. The Ruby Weapon itself was still largely intact when it deactivated, which strongly implies that it was the synthetic auracite running amok that killed her, rather than the damage incurred during the battle.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_072 -- But even after our analysis, I'm afraid we still don't have enough information. For now, perhaps we should consult with Gaius as to our next plan of action.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_111 -- Or you could use the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> and take the most direct route of all: as the crow flies. In fact, this is the perfect chance to put my top secret plan into action.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_113 -- It wouldn't be much of a secret if I told you, now would it?

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_114 -- What I <Emphasis>can</Emphasis> say is there's a starring role planned for you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_115 -- Why so surprised? You didn't think I'd let you get off that easily, did you? It'll be here soon, so don't go anywhere!

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_130 -- I still need to get to the bottom of how the synthetic auracite system works, and whether the pilot's fusion with the core was a malfunction or planned from the start.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_151 -- Here it is, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_100_151 -- I present Garlond Ironworks' adaptation of the Ultima Warrior, the G-Warrior!

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_153 -- Azys Lla, to be precise. We came across it during the course of our investigations and decided it would be a shame to let it go to waste.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_153 -- Azys Lla, to be precise. We came across it during the course of our investigations and decided it would be a shame to let it go to waste.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_155 -- I'm counting on it, as it happens. But first, we'll need to perform a test run in the simulator before throwing you into battle. Come, we haven't much time.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_202 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, we're almost there! You'd better have your wits about you!

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_100_202 -- Now, get ready to strike!

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_205 -- Haha! And save some for me! For research purposes, that is...

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_206 -- That's the <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> I know, always with a joke at the ready! Wait, you're not joking are you?

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_207 -- That sounds awfully familiar...

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_326 -- It's as we feared. I'm sorry, Gaius.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_401 -- We've yet to finish our investigation, but I can give you a preliminary report.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_403 -- Before abandoning the facility, they'd attempted to destroy anything they couldn't take with them, including many of their research materials. Luckily, some information relating to the Sapphire Weapon's combat data was intact.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_405 -- It also appears that the Sapphire Weapon was actually in an incomplete state, and therefore unable to perform at full capacity.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_407 -- Indeed. We may not be so fortunate next time, so we must prepare for the worst. The Ironworks will continue to investigate the Sapphire Weapon and look into possible countermeasures.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_409 -- Improvements were made to the synthetic auracite system to prevent malfunctions? Then it was never their intent to create a manifestation of Nael van Darnus...

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_CID_000_410 -- But there's one thing that <Emphasis>was</Emphasis> intended...

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_CID_000_000 -- Might I have a word with you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? It concerns the chirurgeons. After speaking with them earlier, I learned that they lack sufficient alembics for their needs, you see...

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_CID_000_001 -- So I used some of their broken equipment to craft a more advanced alembic─both as a gesture of goodwill, and as a means to help me recover my memories, since working with my hands kindles familiar feelings.

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_CID_000_002 -- All I require to complete the device are the cores of three ice sprites. Though commonly used to reduce the temperatures of alchemical mixtures, there is a way to alter their properties so that they draw the cold within rather than radiate it without.

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_CID_000_003 -- It must sound ridiculous to you─impossible, even. Yet somehow I <Emphasis>know</Emphasis> it will work.

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_CID_000_020 -- Have you obtained the cores? If so, please show them to me.

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_CID_000_038 -- Why does that man detest us so? Is it all because we interrupted Lord Francel's trial?

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_CID_000_039 -- Whatever his reasons, he clearly means to oppose us at every turn...

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_052 -- Thanks for coming.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_054 -- To tell the truth, we were lucky to obtain any information at all, considering the lengths to which the imperials went in covering their tracks. You see, the hangar below was not just used to store the Weapons, but played a critical role in their creation.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_055 -- We now know the code names given to three of the Weapons. Ruby, Sapphire...and Emerald.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_060 -- Which of course leaves only one option: the sea. According to what fragmented data we were able to recover, the Emerald Weapon is equipped with aquatic capabilities, much like the Sapphire.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_064 -- Hold your chocobos, Severa. It seems that the Emerald Weapon was still incomplete when the VIIth Legion withdrew from Terncliff.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_065 -- It's far more likely that it was transported to another facility in order to add the finishing touches.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_070 -- Sorry to disappoint you, but we're still repairing the damage it sustained during the encounter with the Sapphire Weapon. While Allagan machinery has its uses, it's a bugger to find replacement parts in a pinch...

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_100_070 -- We've actually been working to expand its already impressive arsenal, but the G-Warrior itself is in no fit state for combat.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_071 -- While I'm aware this is a far from adequate replacement, I can provide an Ironworks submersible to help <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and Gaius reach Castrum Marinum. I'll have one sent ahead to Vesper Bay.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_205 -- We got here as soon as we could.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_100_205 -- Not that we could've done anything to prevent this tragedy.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_206 -- From what we know, it seems that the Emerald Weapon was ilm for ilm a great deal more powerful than the previous two. If this is allowed to continue, who knows what sort of monstrosity the VIIth Legion will conceive next.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_207 -- Nevertheless, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> has once again proven <If(PlayerParameter(4))>herself<Else/>himself</If> capable of overcoming the worst the Empire has at its disposal.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_210 -- We will do what we can to spare others from sharing his fate. I and the Ironworks will search this place from top to bottom for clues as to the VIIth Legion's plans.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_213 -- With that in mind, I'll begin my examination of the Emerald Weapon. Carefully, that is.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_280 -- ...Gaius, once we've extracted the core, we'll take it back to Terncliff for analysis.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_281 -- Perhaps she should come with us? There's no use in her staying here.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_CID_000_285 -- 

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_100_041 -- Forgive us for not coming to see you sooner, my friend. As you may have heard, we've had our hands full.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_041 -- In our defense, you <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> up rather early. I was under the impression you'd be slumbering awhile longer.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_100_043 -- Hah! I still struggle with that idea. From where I stand, the secrets of traversing time and space seem exactly as unfathomable as they ever did.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_043 -- But if an alternate version of myself has already laid them bare, I daresay that frees me up to concentrate on other endeavors. Speaking of which, you wanted my help with something. What is it?

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_044 -- Well, well...a treatment for tempering. And for the next step, you need to find the password to this Allagan's report...

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_047 -- Well, I'd love to say that we could help you...so I will. Once suitably configured, a magitek terminal should make short work of identifying the password.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_049 -- Good thinking. I'll transfer the information to a terminal and set it to work right away.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_101 -- Ah, looks like it's finished. Let's see...

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_102 -- “Freedom.” The password is “freedom.”

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_134 -- Hm. In theory, it would be no different from how we identified the password.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_135 -- But it'll take more calculating power. A lot more. I honestly couldn't say whether our equipment would be up to the task.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_137 -- To keep it from prying eyes, of course. Why else?

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_138 -- ...Wait. A password that could be guessed by anyone with leisure and a dictionary wouldn't keep it from a person minded to look.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_139 -- No, he <Emphasis>wanted</Emphasis> his report to be seen...by those who strive for freedom.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_141 -- You two─round up as many magitek terminals as you can find and bring them to the workshop.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_143 -- Things are about to get very busy. Lucky we have you to help, eh?

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_160 -- Right, while G'raha Tia and I configure the terminals, I want the rest of you to procure supplies.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_161 -- Namely, ceruleum to fuel the terminals and ice shards to keep them cool. The more we have of both, the better.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_163 -- In that case, I'll trust <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and Alisaie with the ceruleum. Here's a promissory note for each of you.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_164 -- Take them to the Skysteel Manufactory in Ishgard and the Ceruleum Processing Plant in Thanalan. The people there will give you what we need.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_CID_000_168 -- If Alisaie's bound for the Ceruleum Processing Plant, you'll want to take yourself to the Skysteel Manufactory. Off you go, now.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_107 -- (-Familiar Voice-)Well, it's a good thing you have us to help with that.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_108 -- See those floating rock formations? One might think them a result of the Fourth Umbral Calamity, but they were actually caused by the Bozja incident.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_108 -- See those floating rock formations? One might think them a result of the Fourth Umbral Calamity, but they were actually caused by the Bozja incident.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_109 -- When Dalamud struck the citadel, vast quantities of energy permeated the site, likely carried to every corner of Bozja via aether currents. Certain regions were affected more severely than others, and, well...the results are self-explanatory.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_110 -- Thankfully, we've managed to tap into that energy to erect a barrier to protect from aerial strikes, much like Seiryu's Wall.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_131 -- I can't take all the credit. This wouldn't have been possible without the equipment supplied to us by the Dalmascan resistance.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_132 -- What's more, the idea to use the land's residual energy came from Lilja, one of my newest engineers. So you see, it was a collaborative effort.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_133 -- But as you said, the barrier can only cover so much ground. If the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis> decides to do more than loom ominously in the distance, our troops on the front line won't stand a chance.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_133 -- But as you said, the barrier can only cover so much ground. If the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis> decides to do more than loom ominously in the distance, our troops on the front line won't stand a chance.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_136 -- And pray tell, where might we find one of those?

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_137 -- Yes, yes, point taken. After all, I can't have newcomers like you stealing my thunder. I'll see if I can turn that idea of yours into a workable solution.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_181 -- Your enthusiasm is appreciated, but I'd rather go myself than put any of my workers in harm's way. Besides, this is no job for an engineer. Long story short─the Resistance means to advance on the enemy's position, and to do that, they'll need protection.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_182 -- We aim to erect additional barriers at each outpost they establish along the route to the IVth Legion's base of operations. The trouble is, the residual aether alone may not be enough, so we plan to divert the currents further afield.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_184 -- This is where we were hoping you might be able to help. We need you to take this prototype device and activate it at a specific location.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_190 -- Why, however did you guess? As before, you only need set the device in place and we can handle the rest.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_201 -- 

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_204 -- Yes, well, questionable naming aside, I can vouch for its workmanship. All that remains is to put it through its paces.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_CID_000_207 -- As for me, I'd best get back to the workshop. I'll see if there's aught that can be done about the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis>.

TEXT_LUCKSA302_04085_CID_000_110 -- Mikoto, nooo!!!

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_003 -- (-Familiar Voice-)This isn't the first time the Empire has shown an interest in such relics...

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_005 -- This is all reminiscent to the XIVth Legion's excavation of the Allagan ruins in Ala Mhigo. It was there that they discovered the Ultima Weapon...

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_008 -- So we <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> have another Allagan abomination to contend with. Wonderful...

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_010 -- Perhaps they have something else in mind. It's more likely Menenius is testing it first. Or maybe...he's planning to test it on us.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_013 -- Yes, I believe so.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_014 -- After analyzing the data Mikoto provided on the crystal focus, we should be able to put its energies to good use. Hopefully with explosive results.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_019 -- Precisely. We can ignite the very lifeblood of the warship, destroying it from within!

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_020 -- That's our theory, at any rate. Unfortunately, the crystal focus doesn't possess the energy we require for that level of destabilization.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_022 -- Luckily for us, the aether that permeated the land at the time of the Bozja incident is at our disposal.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_022 -- Luckily for us, the aether that permeated the land at the time of the Bozja incident is at our disposal.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_023 -- If we can use that residual energy to momentarily overcharge the crystal focus, it should release a pulse potent enough to detonate the ceruleum.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_024 -- Even if we can't destroy the warship, the engines would at least be severely damaged.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_026 -- Hopefully, this will give us the opening we need. The aetherwave amplifier I designed for the task should have arrived in Doma by now, but we still have to find a way of transporting it and the crystal focus behind enemy lines.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_028 -- Perfect. Once it arrives, I'll see to shielding its engine against the crystal focus.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_030 -- I like the way you think, Bajsaljen.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_031 -- I've a job for you as well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. We're going to need to place another D.A.M. near the aether current closest to the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis>.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_032 -- I've made a few modifications to allow for manual redirection of the aether it collects. When the <Emphasis>Ia'sar</Emphasis> passes overhead, I want you to channel it directly to us.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_034 -- Which is why I intend to pilot the <Emphasis>Ia'sar</Emphasis> myself. I need to be on board to trigger the pulse, and lest you forget, I don't just build airships, I pilot them, too.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_036 -- I have to, Bajsaljen. For you, and for the people of Bozja. To make amends for what happened all those years ago.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_039 -- There's no need to put yourself in harm's way, Mikoto. Your place is here, helping the others.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_042 -- Is that so?

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_043 -- In that case, you'll be coming with us.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_CID_000_045 -- Mikoto, would you mind accompanying me to Doma? The aetherwave amplifier still needs a little fine-tuning, and I could do with a touch of your scholarly knowledge.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_001 -- Our work on the aetherwave amplifier is complete, and the crystal focus has been mounted on board the <Emphasis>Ia'sar</Emphasis>. That said, it's hard to gauge the range of the pulse it will generate. In the event things don't go to plan, have your men ready to disperse.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_051 -- (-Cid-)We'll be there as soon as we can.
Rinok, Mikoto, it's time to head out.
Did you get all that, Bajsaljen?

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_051 -- (-Cid-)We'll be there as soon as we can.
Rinok, Mikoto, it's time to head out.
Did you get all that, Bajsaljen?

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_304 -- What in the seven hells was that!?

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_310 -- Of all the rotten luck!

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_311 -- (-Cid-)Did you catch that, Lilja? We've lost the coordinates!

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_311 -- (-Cid-)Did you catch that, Lilja? We've lost the coordinates!

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_312 -- (-Cid-)Quickly, send up a flare!

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_312 -- (-Cid-)Quickly, send up a flare!

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_314 -- There!

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_316 -- Come on, don't fail me now!

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_319 -- Mikoto, nooo!!!

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_320 -- Take us down. Now!

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_323 -- What? Who is this?

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_325 -- (-Cid-)Fran...? Right, Jenomis has told me about you.
All right, heading back now.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_325 -- (-Cid-)Fran...? Right, Jenomis has told me about you.
All right, heading back now.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_352 -- I've already spoken with Lord Hien, and his chirurgeons are ready and awaiting her arrival in Doma.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_353 -- Could I trouble you for use of the <Emphasis>Ia'sar</Emphasis>?

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_356 -- You may have glimpsed the future, but you didn't see everything. There was no way of knowing for certain what would happen to any of us.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_357 -- Using the amplifier was my plan, but we all knew the risks involved, including Lilja. This is a war we're fighting, after all.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_358 -- But this is hardly the time to discuss such matters. We have a long journey ahead of us, and I daresay your healing magicks will be of great comfort to her until we reach Doma.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_711 -- (-Familiar Voice-)Well, I for one have every confidence that you will lead Bozja to a bright and prosperous future. If Ala Mhigo and Doma are able to thrive, I see no reason why Bozja can't do the same.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_713 -- And here I thought you might actually take a moment to enjoy your hard-earned victory. Such steadfast dedication to rebuilding Bozja is proof enough the people are in good hands.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_715 -- It was touch and go at first, extracting the shrapnel from her stomach, but she's doing much better now. You should have seen her protesting when we insisted she stay behind to rest.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_CID_000_730 -- Sounds like the chirurgeons are taking good care of you, Lilja, and I trust you won't be giving them any trouble. It'd be a shame if I had to send Jessie to keep an eye on you.

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_CID_000_201 -- We all expected another Weapon to appear sooner or later, but not quite like this.

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_CID_000_204 -- I see that one thing hasn't changed since your days as the Black Wolf: your penchant for gigantic warmachina.

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_CID_000_205 -- But if this means the G-Warrior has another chance to shine, I'd be happy to oblige. Only this time, rather than having it unceremoniously towed by airships, I have a more dynamic entrance in mind.

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_CID_200_205 -- From what I hear, we have you to thank for Avilina volunteering to help the Ironworks. Since she joined the team, our work has come on leaps and bounds.

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_CID_800_205 -- Let me put it like this...

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_CID_900_205 -- Thanks to Avilina's tireless dedication, the G-Warrior has been reborn!

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_CID_000_206 -- But there'll be time to explain more on the way. Come on, the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> is waiting.

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_CID_000_208 -- Since our objective is to rescue the pilot, we've added a means of capturing the Diamond Weapon.

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_CID_000_209 -- We come to save lives, not to end them, and for that reason, the G-Warrior has been reborn. I present to you the G-Savior!

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_CID_000_251 -- Due to the added complexity, we'll have Gaius pilot while <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> handles the various armaments.

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_CID_000_255 -- I'll be monitoring the situation from the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>. Should things take a turn for the worse, I'll be ready to intervene.

TEXT_LUCKYW402_04032_CID_000_054 -- At first, we thought the Weapon's influence had caused this, but it seems there is more to it than that.

TEXT_LUCKYW402_04032_CID_000_055 -- The chirurgeons say that this is most likely the result of intense trauma. Her mind has been scarred, perhaps irrevocably.

TEXT_LUCKYW402_04032_CID_000_060 -- I've never heard of anything so cruel...

TEXT_LUCKYW402_04032_CID_000_062 -- That's one of the many things we're still looking into.

TEXT_LUCKYW402_04032_CID_000_074 -- Times change. People change. And it's just as well─we inventors would soon find ourselves out of work if everything stayed the same. If you've a need for my creations, just say the word.

TEXT_LUCKYW402_04032_CID_000_075 -- You know, Gaius, I could fill a book with all the things I've been meaning to say to you over the years. But what would be the point? What's done is done.
...There is one thing, though.

TEXT_LUCKYW402_04032_CID_000_076 -- If anyone can get through to Allie, it's you. She looks up to you the same way I did as a boy. Don't give up on her.

TEXT_AKTKMG103_04452_CID_000_150 -- The <Emphasis>Ragnarok</Emphasis> is a collaborative effort in every sense.

TEXT_AKTKMG103_04452_CID_000_151 -- The culmination of knowledge from the world's greatest minds, both past and present. Without question the greatest ship ever built.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_063 -- A pleasure as always. I hear you have a job for us?

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_064 -- Heading into the void to find a lost dragon... That sounds almost pedestrian compared to your last adventure. Honestly, I don't know if you could say anything that would surprise me after Meteion and that bloody mess.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_065 -- All right, let's take a look at this talisman of yours. You said there were signs of degradation?

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_066 -- Hm, it seems some manner of corrosion has set in around a scratch on its surface─much as the void's corruption seeped into Nero through his wounds. In which case, our best bet may be to simply prevent the scale from being damaged in the first place.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_068 -- We have a coating agent for strengthening trinkets and the like, but I'd be wary of applying any compound which might upset the scale's delicate alchemical balance. Far safer to dress it in armor.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_069 -- We'll construct a protective casing─one utilizing metal alloys with high aetherial conductivity, so as not to impede the talisman's primary function.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_071 -- Nero has compiled data on the Thirteenth, so I'll have him pitch in with the design just to be sure.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_072 -- If only it weren't such an ordeal to convince him to follow our safety protocols... I swear, I've never had such a reckless employee. In any case, we may need some time to untangle the particulars.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_073 -- If only it weren't such an ordeal to convince him to follow our safety protocols... In any case, we may need some time to untangle the particulars.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_CID_000_075 -- Hah, the hard part will be ducking Jessie and her constant barrage of demands while we sneak about doing the fun stuff. We'll see what we can do.

TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_CID_000_117 -- Did someone say warding scales? Because it just so happens we have them.

TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_CID_000_119 -- You know I am. I was there at the Crystal Tower, lest you forget. I wouldn't miss this for the world.

TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_CID_000_120 -- You don't mind if we come along and see you off, I hope? It's thanks to these three that we could finish the work so quickly.

TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_CID_000_126 -- Don't mention it. Midgardsormr came to our rescue in the rift. It's the least we can do to help his children.

TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_CID_000_128 -- Well, my friend, my only regret is that I won't be able to accompany you on this latest grand adventure.

TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_CID_100_136 -- In that godsforsaken place, he'll need all the help he can get. But you of all people ought to know that, eh?

TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_CID_000_315 -- It's not only us cheering you on, but the alchemists of old too. You couldn't possibly fail.

TEXT_AKTKMI101_04592_CID_000_425 -- Once we've seen you off, we'll take our leave. Wouldn't want to get in the soldiers' way should it come to battle.

She explains that a recent drop in productivity has left them scrambling to make ends meet, and asks to see your magitek armor in the hopes of drawing inspiration for a new product.

While at first taken aback by the sleek design of your suit, she is inevitably disappointed by the damaged weaponry. Unable to bear seeing good steel go to waste, she insists you gather parts so that she may begin repairs immediately.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_SEQ_01 -- Rammbroes and G'raha have been hard at work finding a way to rescue Unei, Doga, and Nero from the World of Darkness. However, their research has revealed a more pressing problem: Emperor Xande's covenant with the voidsent known as the Cloud of Darkness remains in effect, and his orders still control the Crystal Tower. Thus, the Allagan structure continues amassing energy to open a voidgate, and unleash the Cloud upon Eorzea. Should this come to pass, all that is will be destroyed. However, even amidst such dire circumstance, there is a sliver of hope. If NOAH can retrieve Unei and Doga from the dark realm, then the tower can be halted and the covenant broken. Garlond Ironworks has labored to make a machine able to open a small rift, through which a brave band of adventurers can enter the World of Darkness. Cid arrives to inform you the preparations are nearly complete, and bids you speak with Wedge at the Eight Sentinels.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_SEQ_02 -- Wedge ushers you to the throne room of Syrcus Tower. In the moments before opening the rift, G'raha Tia falls into a strange mood, and tells you of a band of heroes in ancient Allag who sought to dethrone Xande. Ultimately, though, they did not succeed in stopping the emperor. History aside, Cid receives word that the Ironworks' machine is ready. With a devilish glint in his eye, the engineer orders the voidgate opened. Lights flash and power hums, and before your very eyes a rift appears. Rammbroes now lays the burden of rescuing your friends from the World of Darkness upon you. As you turn to go, G'raha Tia asks for a moment of your time. Speak with him at the Eight Sentinels to discover what is on his mind.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_SEQ_05 -- After nearly losing Nero to the dark realm, you have safely returned to the Crystal Tower. Rammbroes and Cid are saddened at the loss of Unei and Doga, but they are both happy to learn that your venture into the World of Darkness was a success. G'raha now holds the royal blood of Allag in concentration great enough to control the tower and put an end to the threat it poses. However, Rammbroes realizes─with some prodding─how tiring your journey truly was. So before beginning, he bids you rest for a spell, and speak with him briefly at Saint Coinach's Find.

TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_GRAHATIA_000_022 -- Well, Cid certainly seems to have a firm hand on the helm. Shall we make our way to the Crystal Tower?

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_SEQ_01 -- You tell Cid and Rammbroes of what occurred in the World of Darkness. Suddenly, a researcher dashes up, and tells you in panicked tones that G'raha Tia is ordering researchers out of the Crystal Tower. Hasten back to the Eight Sentinels, and speak with the son of Saint Coinach to discover what is happening.

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_SEQ_03 -- Though the tower is silent and Cid has left to pursue new ventures, Rammbroes vows that NOAH will not disband. He promises to continue onwards─in honor of the wish passed down from ancient Allag, in honor of Unei and Doga's sacrifice, and in honor of G'raha's future. Now, a new dawn has come to Eorzea.

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_GRAHATIA_000_055 -- 'Tis as you say, Cid. We could wait for someone, someday, to reach the same heights as Allag, but by then we will have lost the royal blood <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> the means to control the tower.

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_GRAHATIA_000_058 -- I am deadly serious, Cid. The tower may only be used once men rival the Allagans in knowledge. I will slumber within Syrcus Tower until then, to greet those with the means to open the gates.

TEXT_GAIUSD602_00495_NERO_000_071 -- Good-bye, Cid. I must put all this at my back. Possibility beckons, and I am bound to follow.

And so you part ways with the young vice marshal, who swears to do what he can to clear your names, and climb aboard the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>. After what seems a short journey, you disembark near Camp Dragonhead, where a downcast Alphinaud proposes you seek Lord Haurchefant's counsel.

Before he can dispatch you to inform the authorities, Alphinaud Leveilleur strides into the church and declares Marques to be none other than Master Cid Garlond, who has been missing since the Calamity five years ago. While he has yet to recover his lost memories, Cid senses that the boy speaks the truth, and decides to join him. Resigned, Father Iliud produces Cid's belongings, which the priest had stored for safekeeping. Alphinaud then reveals that the Ixal have summoned Garuda, and that Cid's lost airship, the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, will be required if the surviving Scions are to reach the primal.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_SEQ_01 -- Stirred by the familiar roar of the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>'s engines, Cid endeavors to recall his past; try though he might, he is unable to navigate the dark corridors of his mind alone. But what if he had company? Wielding the power of the Echo, you guide him through a series of forgotten memories, detailing the path that led the once-loyal engineer to turn his back on Garlemald and flee to Eorzea. When you finally awake from the visions, Cid triumphantly declares that he remembers everything─his name, his people, and his purpose. Shortly thereafter, he guides the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> through Garuda's wall of wind without incident, delivering you to the Howling Eye at long last. Speak with Alphinaud before proceeding into the primal's sanctuary.

TEXT_MANFST404_00519_SEQ_04 -- Safely back aboard the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, with the imperial forces now fast-diminishing specks upon the horizon, Cid and Alphinaud begin to discuss how to address this grave new threat.

Having safely arrived in Ul'dah, speak with Alphinaud prior to continuing on to Vesper Bay.

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_SEQ_05 -- After a titanic struggle, you somehow succeed in slaying the dragon, earning yourself the praise of Alphinaud in so doing. Your elation at having survived the encounter is dampened somewhat by the revelation that the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> is more badly damaged than had been hoped. Thankfully, Cid manages to make sufficient repairs to the ship to enable you to make the flight back to Gridania. Speak with Alphinaud, and together determine how best to proceed.

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_ALPHINAUD_000_000 -- As I am sure you will agree, it is past time we entered the Stone Vigil. Pay Lord Drillemont a visit and remind him of his obligation to us─Cid and I will follow anon.

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_ALPHINAUD_000_063 -- Cid─you and I will sneak aboard the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> and prepare it for launch.

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_ALPHINAUD_000_066 -- That settles it, then. Shall we, Cid?

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_ALPHINAUD_000_103 -- Thank the gods for sparing me that inconvenience. I have quite enough to do already. Which reminds me─Cid is working on the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> as we speak. Let us go and see what he has to say.

TEXT_GAIUSC101_00952_ALPHINAUD_000_104 -- What say you, Cid? Will she fly?

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_SEQ_00 -- Cid appears to be deep in thought.

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_SEQ_01 -- In its current condition, the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> cannot endure the tumultuous winds which encircle the Howling Eye, Garuda's sanctuary. To breach the barrier, Cid has devised a plan to harness the power of a corrupted crystal. While he himself has no idea where to find one, he knows a man who might─the scholar, Lamberteint, who resides in Camp Drybone.

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_ALPHINAUD_000_025 -- Though I am no expert on the workings of airships, it seems plain to me that the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> suffered much from her time in the wilderness. Am I not correct, Cid?

TEXT_GAIUSC102_00953_ALPHINAUD_000_042 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I need you to return to Thanalan and seek out this scholar. Cid and I will set about repairing the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> in your absence.

TEXT_GAIUSC307_00974_SEQ_06 -- Hedyn confirms that the foul-smelling, offal-laden crystal is comprised of ice-aspected aether. To your chagrin, you learn that you cannot cleanse the crystal of the spriggan entrails, as the thick coating of digestive juices is the only thing protecting you from the crystal's detrimental effects. Hopefully Cid will have developed a less irksome way to do the same...

TEXT_GAIUSC308_00975_SEQ_01 -- Your inexplicably long and drawn-out quest to secure a corrupted crystal is at last at an end. Deliver the crystal to Cid at the airship landing in New Gridania.

TEXT_GAIUSC308_00975_SEQ_02 -- Cid's work on the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> is nearly complete, and all that remains is for him to test the crystal you have brought. His voice swelling with pride, Cid declares that the airship will soon be transformed into something far greater, something extraordinary. You need only wait to see the fruits of his labor.

TEXT_GAIUSC308_00975_TODO_00 -- Deliver the corrupted crystal to Cid.

TEXT_GAIUSC406_00981_SEQ_07 -- Much to your relief, you find Wedge cowering under the bridge, frightened, cold, and hungry, but otherwise unharmed. Make your way to Monument Tower and await Cid's arrival.

TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_SEQ_01 -- All evidence suggests that Minfilia and the others are being held captive at Castrum Centri. Cid bids you make your way to Revenant's Toll in Mor Dhona, and solicit the local adventurers for information.

TEXT_GAIUSC411_00986_SEQ_04 -- You return to Revenant's Toll and report all you have learned to Alphinaud. Glad for your tidings, he bids you speak with Cid for the details of the rescue mission.

TEXT_GAIUSC411_00986_SEQ_05 -- Ever enthused, Glaumunt is currently looking into the procurement of a suit of magitek armor. In the meantime, Cid requires your assistance for some preparation of his own.

TEXT_GAIUSC411_00986_TODO_03 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_GAIUSC411_00986_ALPHINAUD_000_051 -- ...So Minfilia and the others are indeed at Castrum Centri! Their presence thus confirmed, we may proceed with the mission. While you were afield, Cid took the liberty of devising a plan of action. Pray have the details from him.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_SEQ_01 -- In order to hinder communication among imperial forces, Cid declares his intent to put together a makeshift jamming device. To this end, he lends you his electromagnetic reader, which he bids you use at the hill-sized cluster of corrupted crystals to the west of Revenant's Toll.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_SEQ_02 -- You have taken sufficient readings. Return to Revenant's Toll and report to Cid.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_SEQ_03 -- Cid is satisfied that the crystals will suit his needs, though he expresses his reluctance to harness their power.

TEXT_GAIUSC601_01001_TODO_01 -- Report to Cid.

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_SEQ_03 -- You have succeeded in acquiring a magitek reaper, though some repairs will be required before it can be put to use. Cid bids you meet him back at his workshop in Revenant's Toll. Speak with Slafborn at the front door to be admitted.

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_SEQ_04 -- You arrive at Cid's workshop to find that Biggs and Wedge have already set about repairing the magitek reaper. When their work is complete, it will finally be time to undertake the most dangerous phase of the mission: the rescue itself.

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_TODO_02 -- Report to Cid.

TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_SLAFBORN_000_950 -- ...The magitek armor? Cid and the others took it inside. Go on in and join them.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_SEQ_00 -- Cid would have you assist in the repair of the magitek armor.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_SEQ_01 -- According to Cid, the magitek core at the heart of the reaper's servomechanism is worn beyond use. Unfortunately, a replacement will not be easy to come by in Eorzea. Speak with Wedge and learn of his proposed solution.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_SEQ_03 -- You have acquired a shiny new mammet heart. Return to Cid's workshop in Revenant's Toll, and deliver it to Wedge.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_SEQ_11 -- Soon after Wedge's bizarre welcoming ritual, you are discovered by imperial troops bent on reclaiming or destroying the magitek armor. Disinclined to relinquish your prize, you repel the enemy, at which time the reaper seemingly responds to your presence. While the workings of advanced machina are foreign to you, Cid and the others take this awakening to mean that the servomechanism is now fully functional. If the experts are convinced, who are you to say otherwise? Time to make your way back to Cid's workshop in Revenant's Toll.

TEXT_GAIUSC605_01005_TODO_02 -- Deliver the mammet heart to Wedge at Cid's workshop.

TEXT_GAIUSC901_01036_ALPHINAUD_000_062 -- Minfilia, Cid, and I shall accompany the main host in an advisory capacity. It will be our task to analyze intelligence as it comes into our possession, and make the necessary recommendations to command.

TEXT_JOBMNK500_01066_ERIK_000_051 -- Bugger opening your infernal chakra, and open your bloody <Emphasis>ears</Emphasis> for once! Cid Garlond of the Ironworks that bear his name once wrote that these Silvertear Falls lie at the center of our world.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_SEQ_02 -- Upon arriving at your destination, you find the Sons of Saint Coinach making preparations for an expedition into the forbidding Crystal Tower─aided by your old friend Cid Garlond. Speak with Rammbroes when you are ready to assist in the Sons' mission to understand and preserve the potent technology of the fallen Allagan Empire.

TEXT_GAIUSD201_01199_SEQ_03 -- According to Rammbroes, the entrance to the Crystal Tower is guarded by potent elemental defenses which will need to be circumvented before any expedition into the structure can be attempted. Cid's research suggests that the wrath of the elements can theoretically be reflected by crystals of sufficient clarity. Unfortunately, such flawless specimens are most likely to be found in the midst of the various beast tribe strongholds, and will not be had without a fight. It falls to you to obtain a flawless earth crystal from U'Ghamaro Mines in outer La Noscea, and a flawless water crystal from the Sapsa Spawning Grounds in western La Noscea by participating in the FATEs “Stopping the Shakes” and “Making Waves,” respectively.

TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_SEQ_08 -- After delivering the two samples of aethersand, you regale Cid with tales of his indefatigable employees' most recent misadventures. When thoughts subsequently turn to the two outstanding varieties of aethersand, Rammbroes declares that he has made “arrangements” to procure them. Quite what form these arrangements may take is unclear, but his expression betrays no small amount of apprehension...

TEXT_GAIUSD203_01201_SEQ_06 -- Back in Mor Dhona, Cid processes the flawless crystals of wind and water using the aethersand you procured, finally completing the set of “fangs” required to penetrate the Crystal Tower's defenses. Soon after, you are joined by Biggs, Wedge, and the owner of the voice which pursued you around the Twelveswood─one G'raha Tia. The expedition team thus assembled, it is time at last to find out what momentous discoveries await within the Allagans' glittering spire.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_SEQ_02 -- To the great relief of all concerned, the crystal “fangs” make short work of the tower's lethal outer defenses. Reasoning that the structure's inner reaches are like to contain further hazards, Cid volunteers you for the task of securing the Labyrinth of the Ancients. Rid the maze of anything which might pose a threat to the survey team.

※The Labyrinth of the Ancients can be accessed via the Duty Finder.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_SEQ_03 -- Along with your steadfast adventuring companions, you have succeeded in ridding the labyrinth of its deadly protectors. Cid and G'raha Tia praise your invaluable contribution to the expedition, and together you gaze upon the shimmering spire that rises from the center of the maze.

TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_GRAHATIA_000_011 -- Cid, you are the only one of our number who has ever crossed this threshold. I ask that you take the lead for the present.

TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_SEQ_02 -- The most significant finding of your initial survey is also the most obvious: namely that the long-dormant mechanisms of the Crystal Tower have somehow been reawakened. In order to ascertain what coaxed them into motion after several thousand years of stillness, there is no recourse but to forge onwards and upwards into the spire itself. Given the danger inherent in this proposition, however, it is agreed that no further forays should be made until Cid and his assistants have conducted an exhaustive analysis of the tower's next line of defense. Faced with the prospect of a lengthy delay, G'raha Tia warns you against idleness, doubtless anticipating that the challenges to come will punish any hint of rustiness in your technique.

TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_NERO_000_046 -- And so long as my ambition burns, I shall strive to seize it. The dream lives on, Cid... Do not disappoint me!

TEXT_BANIXA005_01490_COLSON_000_045 -- Of course, it was not until around thirty years later, when Cid Garlond brought airship technology to Eorzea, that flights between cities became a regular occurrence.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_SEQ_01 -- Rammbroes informs you that the investigation of the Crystal Tower is being hindered by the most mundane of security measures: a gate that refuses to open. Even as Cid and G'raha Tia rack their brains to find a solution, two peculiar individuals arrive and offer their aid. They introduce themselves as Doga and Unei, scholars of ancient Allag sent by the Students of Baldesion. Though Rammbroes is at first suspicious of their origin, he relents at G'raha Tia's behest, and allows them to join NOAH in an advisory capacity. Without further ado, Doga and Unei are asked to examine the sealed gate which leads into Syrcus Tower. Accompany the two scholars to the Eight Sentinels, and there speak with Biggs to be shown to the gate.

TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_GRAHATIA_000_005 -- Cid and I have tried every trick we know, but without success. Frankly speaking, we are at a loss.

TEXT_GAIUSE313_01454_MINFILIA_000_015 -- And then there is Cid and the fellowship of NOAH, racing to unlock the mysteries of ancient Allag that we might be spared the horror of another Ultima Weapon.

TEXT_GAIUSE315_01456_MINFILIA_100_015 -- And then there is Cid and the fellowship of NOAH, racing to unlock the mysteries of ancient Allag that we might be spared the horror of another Ultima Weapon.

TEXT_HEAVNZ029_01479_SEQ_03 -- The battleship loomed before them, a gargantuan mass of steel, bristling with cannons, each trained on the <Emphasis>Enterprise Excelsior</Emphasis>. Cid's knuckles were white as he gripped the controls, straining to steer the tiny vessel through the storm of ordnance. They fell about as the deck lurched hither and yon, each explosion inviting a cry of protest from the battered ship...

TEXT_HEAVNA116_01595_SEQ_05 -- The chieftain of the Vanu then cries out to the heavens, and a gargantuan flying whale appears to answer his call. Bismarck, Lord of the Mists, the chieftain names it, and Haurchefant realizes with horror that the creature is a primal. Fortunately, before the monster can swallow you whole, Cid Garlond swoops down aboard the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> and spirits you away.

TEXT_HEAVNA116_01595_SEQ_06 -- It would seem that Cid's perfectly timed rescue was a product of happy coincidence, as he had come to Camp Cloudtop to inspect the <Emphasis>Protector</Emphasis>. So it was that he happened to be present when Honoroit returned from Voor Sian Siran, begging for assistance. Having ensured your safety, he confirms his intent to return to his work on the Ishgardian airship, but promises that you will speak again soon.

TEXT_HEAVNA116_01595_TODO_04 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_SEQ_00 -- Estinien would have you enlist the aid of Cid Garlond.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_SEQ_01 -- Estinien is forced to concede that Cid's expertise may be your only hope of breaking through the Aery's tempestuous barrier. While the Azure Dragoon keeps vigil over Nidhogg's lair, you are to enlist your old friend's aid. Make your way back to Ishgard, and rendezvous with Alphinaud at Saint Reinette's Forum.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_SEQ_03 -- Lord Emmanellain is only too happy to furnish you with the latest gossip surrounding Cid and the Holy See's ill-fated airship. Make your way to Ishgard's airship landing and seek out your old friend.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_SEQ_04 -- You locate Cid at the airship landing, and Alphinaud wastes no time describing your predicament. Wary of pitting the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> against foes as agile as the Dravanians, however, Cid suggests you take a look at his employees' latest project. Head over to the Skysteel Manufactory and speak with Biggs.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_SEQ_05 -- Biggs and Wedge proudly display their newest invention─a diminutive airship known as a “manacutter.” As they set about explaining the craft's various advantages and disadvantages, however, the door bursts open to admit a panting Tataru. The receptionist has news of the sultana! Noting the urgency of the situation, Cid bids you concentrate on matters in Ul'dah while he and his engineers continue work on the manacutter.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_TODO_02 -- Speak with Cid at the airship landing.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_ALPHINAUD_000_005 -- I suggest we rendezvous back at Saint Reinette's Forum, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. From what I gleaned of the Holy See's decidedly <Emphasis>ambitious</Emphasis> airship project, Cid will still be in Ishgard.

TEXT_HEAVNA328_01629_ALPHINAUD_000_023 -- The airship landing? Yes, I thought as much. Come, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─we must find Cid and trouble him for his expert opinion.

TEXT_HEAVNA332_01633_SEQ_01 -- Alphinaud asks that you return to Ishgard to check on the progress of the manacutter while he coordinates the ongoing search efforts with the remaining Crystal Braves. Make your way to the Skysteel Manufactory and speak with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA332_01633_SEQ_02 -- Though confounded by your uncannily perfect timing, Cid is happy to announce the near-completion of the manacutter prototype. Whilst he and his employees make the final adjustments to their latest creation, he bids you visit Fortemps Manor, where Estinien awaits.

TEXT_HEAVNA332_01633_TODO_00 -- Speak with Cid at the Skysteel Manufactory.

TEXT_HEAVNA333_01634_SEQ_01 -- With no further obstacles to bar your entrance to the Aery, Estinien is eager to be underway. Return to the Skysteel Manufactory, and collect the manacutters from Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA333_01634_SEQ_02 -- At the manufactory, Cid, Wedge, and Biggs take turns reassuring you that their manacutters are equal to the task of piercing the barrier around the Aery. Seeing no further need to delay, Estinien bids you fly with him to Nidhogg's lair forthwith. It would seem that the time has come at last to face the dread wyrm in a battle that could bring an end to a thousand years of suffering.

TEXT_HEAVNA333_01634_TODO_00 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_SEQ_02 -- Cid's cheery demeanor soon darkens when he learns of Lord Haurchefant's death and the archbishop's escape. Though he can offer no insight into the meaning of “Azys Lla,” he surmises that it is the source of some phenomenal cosmic power which Thordan VII covets. Recognizing the gravity of the threat, he agrees to help, and bids you join him at the airship landing when you are ready to depart.

TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_TODO_00 -- Speak with Cid at the Skysteel Manufactory.

TEXT_HEAVNA501_01642_ALPHINAUD_000_013 -- Cid, have you ever heard of “Azys Lla”? The archbishop spoke of it before he fled.

TEXT_HEAVNA502_01643_SEQ_01 -- Ever one to take the feelings of others into consideration, Alphinaud states that he will inform Tataru of your plans, and bids you go on ahead to the airship landing. Let Cid know that he will be along shortly.

TEXT_HEAVNA502_01643_TODO_00 -- Speak with Cid at the airship landing.

TEXT_HEAVNA504_01645_SEQ_03 -- Shortly after you and Alphinaud arrive in the Vanu village, the sound of cannon fire reverberates throughout the Sea of Clouds, sending everyone scrambling to search for the source. When Cid subsequently arrives, he explains that the imperials have engaged Bismarck, and together you turn your eyes heavensward even as the primal's massive body casts a shadow over all. Before your disbelieving eyes, Bismarck opens wide its great maw and swallows an island whole. At this, Lonu Vanu cries out with a mixture of rage and despair, but refuses to dwell on the actions of an unfathomable god, instead urging you to speak with Sonu Vanu, chieftain of the Zundu.

TEXT_HEAVNA504_01645_ALPHINAUD_000_043 -- We are honored to meet you, Chief Sonu. I am Alphinaud Leveilleur, and these are my companions <Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight> and Cid Garlond.

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_SEQ_03 -- Heeding your request, Kunu Vali recounts the tale of Bismarck's death at the hands of his brothers and of his heavenly rebirth. The keeper further explains that Bismarck is a merciful, loving being, who guided the Vanu to the islands in the Sea of Clouds─a depiction wholly at odds with his recent behavior. Seek out Alphinaud and share your findings with him and Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA505_01646_SEQ_04 -- Inspired by a comment of Alphinaud's on the subject of skyfishing, Cid conceives a plan to slay Bismarck. By towing a small island through the Sea of Clouds, he hopes to lure the ravenous primal out of hiding, and drag the beast in close with chains fired from dragonkillers. Should the plan succeed, you would be able to engage Bismarck directly─but should it fail, you and your allies would be at the creature's mercy. For want of a better idea, Alphinaud endorses the plan. Now all you need is an island...

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_SEQ_02 -- Swayed by Alphinaud's impassioned denunciation of Bismarck as a false savior, Chief Sonu declares that you will have your island. Inform Cid that you have fulfilled your part of the bargain.

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_SEQ_03 -- Cid's preparations have proceeded smoothly, and the required chains and ballistas have already been delivered to the Sea of Clouds. You need but notify Wedge when you have assembled your party of brave companions, and you will be ferried to the island provided by the Zundu.

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_SEQ_05 -- You execute Cid's bold plan to perfection, and the Lord of Mists falls like so many before him. Soon after, the long-silent voice of Hydaelyn resounds in your mind once more, though you must strain to make out Her words. Alas, it fades as quickly as it came, and you are left to wonder at Her intent...

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_TODO_01 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_ALPHINAUD_000_000 -- Well, you heard Cid. We need an island to bait the hook.

TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_ALPHINAUD_100_016 -- Come, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─let us see how Cid's preparations are progressing.

TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_SEQ_02 -- Concerned that imperial troops may have attacked the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> as well, Alphinaud bids you return to Cid while he and Lucia inform the Zundu of Bismarck's demise. Return to the airship and confirm that all is well.

TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_SEQ_03 -- After learning that the engineers did not run afoul of the Garleans, you recount the tale of your meeting with the Emperor to Cid, who reacts more or less as you expected he would. Alphinaud and Lucia return shortly thereafter and inform you that, miraculously, no Zundu died in the imperial raid. Reasoning that Varis would have leveled the Vanu settlement by now if that were his intention, Alphinaud concludes that the Emperor has already fixed his sights on Azys Lla. Happily, repairs to the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> are complete, and the hunt for the archbishop can continue in earnest.

TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_TODO_01 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_ALPHINAUD_000_001 -- Let us go and inform Chief Sonu of our victory. Cid and the others will need a moment to tend to the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, besides.

TEXT_HEAVNA508_01649_SEQ_00 -- Judging from Cid's expression, he has news which he believes will please you.

TEXT_HEAVNA508_01649_SEQ_01 -- Having calculated the precise direction of the beam of light, Wedge now knows the heading that will lead you to Azys Lla. And so, with Lucia's magitek armor safely stowed aboard the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, you at last resume your pursuit of the <Emphasis>Soleil</Emphasis>.

As the land of the Vanu disappears into the distance, Lucia reveals her true identity. She is Lucia goe Junius, Garlean defector, and sister to Livia sas Junius, whom you slew in battle. Sensing your discomfort, Lucia claims to hold no grudge against you─and given her recent performance in battle, Cid is more than happy to take her at her word.

Some hours later, your comrade's calculations are confirmed when the clouds part to reveal the floating isle of Azys Lla. Alas, your progress is halted soon after by a powerful energy barrier which threatens to tear the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> apart. Frustrated, Cid turns the airship around and sets course for Ishgard, lamenting the Allagans' knack for making the simplest of tasks so infernally bloody complicated.

TEXT_HEAVNA508_01649_SEQ_02 -- The thought of repairing the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> yet again is enough to fill Cid with dread. On the other hand, any landing you can walk away from...

TEXT_HEAVNA508_01649_TODO_00 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA508_01649_ALPHINAUD_000_012 -- Cid's piloting under pressure was a marvel to behold─and may I never have the opportunity to do so again.

TEXT_HEAVNA601_01650_SEQ_02 -- Cid believes that it may be possible to pierce the barrier surrounding Azys Lla by mounting a ram of condensed aether on the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>. There is just one problem: he has not the faintest idea how to make one. Apparently, designing such a device would require the expertise of a true authority in the field─an authority such as an Archon. Even as Alphinaud laments their absence, Edmont recalls a discussion he had with Tataru, wherein she claimed to have acquired a clue pointing to the whereabouts of one of your missing comrades. Make your way to the Forgotten Knight and trouble her for the particulars.

TEXT_HEAVNA601_01650_ALPHINAUD_000_000 -- Assuming Cid is correct─and I have no reason to think that he is not─the Vanu's key is required to pass through the barrier protecting Azys Lla.

TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_SEQ_01 -- After a moment's reflection, Matoya deciphers the contents of the tome, that Cid might avail himself of her research and build the aetheric ram. However, the question of an energy source remains. Even as you mull over the dilemma, Alphinaud has an epiphany: the Eye is a boundless source of aether! ...But will Estinien relinquish it? Ask Alphinaud how he means to proceed.

TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_SEQ_03 -- Aymeric agrees to speak with Estinien on the matter of the Eye. While he does so, seek out Cid at the airship landing and share with him the knowledge of the aetheric converger.

TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_SEQ_04 -- With the knowledge to build the aetheric ram finally at his disposal, and a suitable energy source secured, Cid sets to work with obvious relish.

TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_TODO_02 -- Speak with Cid at the airship landing in Ishgard.

TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_ALPHINAUD_000_019 -- Let us next speak with Cid. He will doubtless be eager to begin work on the aetheric ram.

TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_YSHTOLA_000_021 -- Greetings, Cid. It has been a while.

TEXT_HEAVNA613_01662_SEQ_01 -- While waiting for Cid to finish building the aetheric ram, Alphinaud suggests that you pay a visit to those who will remain in Ishgard. Begin by speaking with Aymeric, who stands nearby.

TEXT_HEAVNA613_01662_ALPHINAUD_000_001 -- Alas, Cid requires my assistance with Master Matoya's rather singular writings. Might I entrust the task of visiting those who will remain behind to you?

TEXT_HEAVNA613_01662_ALPHINAUD_000_002 -- Before we depart for Azys Lla, it is only meet that we bid farewell to those who will remain behind. I should be obliged if you would attend to this, while I assist Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_SEQ_05 -- All are determined that Ysayle's sacrifice should not be in vain. Join your companions at the dome-like structure, and ask Cid for further instructions.

TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_SEQ_06 -- Cid declares the area safe, and calls a meeting to discuss the next step.

TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_TODO_03 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_TODO_04 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_ALPHINAUD_000_0052 -- Cid is right. We owe it to Ysayle to see the mission through.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_SEQ_00 -- Cid looks like a man with a plan.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_SEQ_01 -- Having established a base camp, Cid suggests that you find one of the terminals connected to the isle's operational heart. Search the area for an active terminal.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_SEQ_02 -- Your search has yielded nothing. Return to base camp and report to Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_SEQ_03 -- As he ponders your report, Cid notices with a start that Wedge has wandered off without a word. Help him find his absent-minded colleague before trouble does.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_SEQ_04 -- You find Wedge, who in his turn has found a curious spherical...<Emphasis>thing</Emphasis>, which turns out to be a “guidance node.” Ask Cid what he makes of this discovery.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_TODO_01 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_TODO_03 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNA702_01664_ALPHINAUD_000_007 -- Cid is right. We owe it to Ysayle to see the mission through.

TEXT_HEAVNA703_01665_ALPHINAUD_000_012 -- Cid, the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis> is our sole means of escape. Pray remain here and have her ready to depart at a moment's notice.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_SEQ_02 -- Upon arriving at your destination, you find the Sons of Saint Coinach making preparations for an expedition into the forbidding Crystal Tower─aided by your old friend Cid Garlond. Speak with Rammbroes when you are ready to assist in the Sons' mission to understand and preserve the potent technology of the fallen Allagan Empire.

TEXT_GAIUSX201_01709_SEQ_03 -- According to Rammbroes, the entrance to the Crystal Tower is guarded by potent elemental defenses which will need to be circumvented before any expedition into the structure can be attempted. Cid's research suggests that the wrath of the elements can theoretically be reflected by crystals of sufficient clarity. Unfortunately, such flawless specimens are most likely to be found in the midst of the various beast tribe strongholds, and will not be had without a fight. It falls to you to obtain a flawless earth crystal from U'Ghamaro Mines in outer La Noscea, and a flawless water crystal from the Sapsa Spawning Grounds in western La Noscea.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_SEQ_01 -- A panicked Slowfix informs you of the presence of a new primal─a colossus of steam and steel that has risen from the waters of the Thaliak. Soon after, Y'shtola arrives bearing still more sobering news: though the machine was active for but a moment, her measurements indicate that it is drawing aether from the hinterlands at a rate that will render the entire area lifeless within the space of a few moons. While she seeks Matoya's counsel on how the metal giant might be denied access to this aether, she bids you keep watch over it alongside Cid. Seek him out at Bigwest Shortstop.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_SEQ_02 -- Cid tells you that the Illuminati─the secretive fraternity of goblin scholars─were responsible for summoning the primal. Given the mechanical nature of the giant, he believes your best hope lies in seeking out and destroying whatever passes for its engine. Whilst Cid questions Brayflox about the Illuminati, he bids you join Biggs in the Makers' Quarter and aid him in finding a way inside the colossus.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_SEQ_06 -- Using Roundrox's glowstone and an Ironworks decoder, Wedge reveals that the Illuminati are sending out...gibberish. Luck appears to be on your side, however, as a treasure hunter by the name of Mide appears soon after, and offers you her aid. Thanks to her, Biggs succeeds in opening the hatch just as Cid arrives. Though he was able to glean little of use from Brayflox concerning the primal or the Illuminati, he speculates that the metal giant is akin to an exceedingly large mammet─meaning that you need only locate and destroy its core to end the threat it poses. Gird your loins for whatever awaits you within the colossal machine, and set about exploring its interior.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_SLOWFIX_000_001 -- Y'shtola and Cid leave to learn more, but are not back yet! Great is plight of gobbieflock! Giant is too big, can squash Idyllshire flat! Where are uplanders!?

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_YSHTOLA_000_014 -- “To you,” I say, for I would leave the fate of Idyllshire in your hands. Should the primal chance to stir ere my return, you are to join Cid in repelling it. An unenviable task, but one for which you are singularly qualified.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_YSHTOLA_000_017 -- Rest assured, I do not mean to linger with Master Matoya any longer than necessary. The moment we find a solution, I shall make haste to rejoin you here. Well then, let us be about our duties. I will leave you to discuss strategies with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_SLOWFIX_000_018 -- Pssshkoh... Backrix is keeper of knowings for Idyllshire, can say where Cid has gone. Uplander should start with Backrix.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_BACKRIX_000_050 -- Backrix is keeper of knowings and data! What does uplander wish to learn about? Ah, uplander comes in search of Cid, yes?

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_BACKRIX_000_075 -- Pssshkoh... Backrix makes record of uplanders' lipflaps. Cid says...go to Biggs near river shore.

TEXT_HEAVNR102_02091_SEQ_03 -- On your way out of the colossus, you encounter Cid, Mide, and Roundrox, who have taken the opportunity to survey the interior. As you look on, the treasure hunter searches through the belongings of a fallen goblin, seemingly in vain. When Cid subsequently asks what she is looking for, she tells him that her prize is the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis>...just as the goblin machinist suggested during your encounter with Quickthinx Allthoughts. The tome, written some hundred years past, apparently holds the plans for a variety of technological wonders. Chief among them is the invention known as “Alexander”─a walking citadel designed to serve as a bastion of reason and logic. Plainly, it is this ideal that gave form to the Illuminati's primal. Return to Biggs, and relate all that you have learned.

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_SEQ_00 -- Judging by the twinkle in Biggs's eye, Cid has a plan.

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_SEQ_01 -- Cid reveals that something about the Illuminati's scheme has been puzzling him, namely their decision to send coded communications disclosing the secret to entering Gordias. For whom were these messages intended? The answer, he concludes, is a spy─an agent who needs a way to re-enter the stronghold. Accordingly, he continues, he has ordered that the area around the primal's hand be cleared, hoping to entice Illuminati operatives into revealing themselves. Scant moments later, Wedge receives word that Brayflox has been seen entering the colossus. You can only conclude that she is not who she seems. Join Cid and Mide in pursuing the impostor into the giant.

※The Arm of the Father can be accessed via the Duty Finder.

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_SEQ_03 -- Before you can apprehend the spy, Quickthinx Allthoughts and his guards emerge from a nearby corridor and gun her down. Betraying no hint of remorse, the Illuminati Grand Master then announces that he has been searching for the “missing piece” required to make the world perfect, prompting Cid to fire back that his perfect world will be nothing more than a dead star. Alas, no words will dissuade the Illuminati from their course, and the goblins soon depart to enact their plan...

Sensing Cid's frustration, Mide reveals that she knows how to shut down the primal's core, and Roundrox adds that she can assist you in identifying its location. Accordingly, Cid bids you make your way outside and prepare for what promises to be an eventful mission. Meet with Mide at Bigwest Shortstop and discuss how best to proceed.

TEXT_HEAVNR103_02092_MIDE_000_510 -- No, Cid. Like the rest of the ideas set out in the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis>, Alexander is wonderful in itself. Perfect, even. But in the rush to realize its ideals, even the best of us can be led astray.

TEXT_HEAVNR105_02094_SEQ_02 -- You arrive to find Roundrox distraught over the inexplicable theft of her pile of treasures. Mercifully, it would seem the Illuminati who stole them did not get far, as Cid and Biggs soon return with an unconscious thief, along with two crates loaded with the young goblin's missing items. Roundrox subsequently deduces that the Illuminati were actually looking for her glowstone─little suspecting that it was sitting at the heart of the Ironworks' decoding device all along. To everyone's surprise, the strange crystal lights up at the child's touch, revealing itself to be a fragment of the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis>...and the missing piece of Quickthinx's plan. Though it is safe for the time being, Cid is certain that the Illuminati will not stop until they have claimed their prize, and counsels you to be ready. After a brief celebration, you make to leave, but sense that Roundrox has something more to say. Speak with the child, and find out what it could be.

TEXT_HEAVNY202_02115_SEQ_02 -- Chief Sonu believes the gemstone in your possession is a relic of great power. If smashed against a Vundu aetheryte nestled in the Whale's Crown, it will render Bismarck vulnerable... Yet, upon further reflection, you recall no mention of the white whale's newfound invulnerability prior to this. That said, if the primal does have some form of protection, it will need to be circumvented before he can be defeated. Inform Cid of your new task.

TEXT_HEAVNY202_02115_SEQ_03 -- Cid seems poised to explain in detail how Chief Sonu's request makes no sense whatsoever. However, he instead hazards that it might bring you good luck.

TEXT_HEAVNY202_02115_SEQ_04 -- With all your might, you smash the gemstone against the aetheryte...and nothing much happens. Out of habit, you attune with the aetheryte...and again, nothing much happens. If your actions had any meaning, it remains to be seen. In any case, Cid is waiting.

TEXT_HEAVNY202_02115_TODO_01 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNR201_02249_SEQ_04 -- Shortly after you join Biggs, Wedge appears with Cid and Y'shtola in tow. Y'shtola is keen to observe the unusual fluctuations in aetheric energy, while Cid has been enlisted to offer advice on the plan of attack. With the team duly assembled, Wedge unveils a new invention: a device which he plans to use to throw Illuminati communications into disarray, affording you an opportunity to take them unawares. Upon activating the device, however, another of Alexander's giant limbs screeches into life, coming to rest on the opposite bank of the Thaliak. Though all has not gone quite to plan, it seems the hatch to the left arm is momentarily unguarded, and your comrades bid you take advantage of the chaos caused by the colossus's sudden awakening to enter while you still hold the element of surprise. Hurry across the Thaliak and speak with Lightkix Eyesfixed who guards the bank where Alexander's arm chanced to fall.

TEXT_HEAVNR201_02249_YSHTOLA_000_424 -- I must needs discuss these developments with Master Matoya. Cid, would you be so good as to accompany me? Your insight may well prove useful.

TEXT_HEAVNR205_02253_SEQ_02 -- You confer with Mide, Biggs, and Wedge, and learn that the goblin standing guard in front of the primal has corroborated Backrix's claims. After exploring several theories, you have no choice but to consider the possibility that something is odd about the passage of time within the barrier around Alexander. At a loss to know how to proceed, Biggs suggests seeking Cid's opinion, and Wedge duly requests his presence via linkpearl. All that remains is to await the arrival of the Ironworks' finest mind.

TEXT_HEAVNR205_02253_SEQ_03 -- Cid and Y'shtola have scarcely arrived when the ground begins to tremble. Fearing the worst, you rush to gain a better view of Alexander, and Cid witnesses a surprising phenomenon: the flow of aether that had been leaking from the primal reverses, as if time itself had been turned back. For all their combined knowledge, neither Cid nor Y'shtola can offer a credible explanation for this unprecedented event, and they are forced to concede that Alexander may possess a means to manipulate time... Though the implications of this explanation are grim beyond reckoning, none of your companions seem ready to admit defeat just yet. Trouble Wedge for his thoughts on your predicament.

TEXT_HEAVNR205_02253_SEQ_04 -- Wedge informs you that Cid and Y'shtola have returned to Matoya's Cave, and seems optimistic that their combined intellect will succeed in identifying some means to combat the Illuminati. With that, he and Biggs trudge back to the Shortstop, while Mide indicates that there is something she wishes to discuss with you upon your return.

TEXT_HEAVNR205_02253_TODO_01 -- Wait for Cid to arrive.

TEXT_HEAVNR205_02253_YSHTOLA_000_701 -- Cid insisted that I accompany him─though I would have come even had he not. Matters have taken a turn for the worse, I gather.

TEXT_HEAVNG101_02356_SEQ_02 -- As the council debates how best to combat the incalculable threat contained within the cocoon of light, an unexpected figure seizes his moment to take the stage: Nero tol Scaeva. The disgraced imperial engineer proceeds to proffer what might kindly be termed a “bold” solution to the problem, and is duly ridiculed by Cid. The Alliance leaders, however, are not so quick to dismiss the man's proposal, anything being preferable to another Calamity, and they grudgingly agree to send a contingent to awaken the infamous Allagan weapon known as “Omega.” Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on this surprising turn of events.

TEXT_HEAVNG101_02356_ALISAIE_000_003 -- Yes. But the Elder Seedseer doubtless shares our concerns about how long it will remain so. I am told that Cid Garlond has been called in to add his expertise to proceedings.

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_SEQ_00 -- Alphinaud is eager to join Cid and the others.

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_SEQ_01 -- Alphinaud informs you that the Omega contingent is assembling at the airship landing. Make haste and join Cid and the others.

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_SEQ_02 -- Cid seems bent on heading directly for Carteneau, but Alphinaud requests a short delay to confirm the situation in the East Shroud before departing. Having acquiesced to Alphinaud's wish, Cid offers to fly the remaining members of the contingent to Mor Dhona. Speak with Hida at the landing gate when you are ready to board the <Emphasis>Enterprise Excelsior</Emphasis>.

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_SEQ_03 -- After a brief flight, you arrive a short distance from the walls of Revenant's Toll. Speak with Cid before making your way into town.

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_SEQ_04 -- Cid apologizes for not being able to land within the settlement proper, and suggests that you all retire to the Rising Stones. Perhaps this would be a suitable place to approach Nero, and learn more of your unexpected ally...

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_TODO_00 -- Speak with Cid at the airship landing in Gridania.

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_TODO_02 -- Speak with Cid in Mor Dhona.

TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_ALPHINAUD_000_001 -- Cid and the others are assembling at the airship landing.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_SEQ_01 -- After the briefest of discussions, the contingent for the Omega expedition is decided, with Cid and Nero providing the technical expertise, while you, Yugiri, Gosetsu, and─most unexpectedly─Yda supply the steel. Make your way to the northern bank of Silvertear Lake, where the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis> is waiting, and inform Cid of your readiness to depart.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_SEQ_02 -- You arrive in Carteneau to find that Nero spoke the truth when he declared that you were not the only ones with designs on the slumbering relic. Challenged by a brutish Garlean soldier named Grynewaht, you are soon embroiled in a skirmish with imperial forces. Rather predictably, Nero abandons you without hesitation, employing a teleporter to travel deeper into the facility, and Cid duly pursues him, leaving you to see to the small matter of winning the battle.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_SEQ_03 -- With a helping hand from your favorite former tribunus, you eventually rout your adversaries, and press on into Omega's control room. There you find Cid and Nero hard at work priming the relic for action, but it is Yda who finally takes it upon herself to press the launch button. Even as Omega takes flight, you cannot help but wonder if you have made a terrible mistake...

Initially, all seems to be proceeding as planned, but just as you begin to breathe a little more easily, the signal emanating from the weapon falls silent, prompting Cid to reengage its stasis systems. Struggling to hide his concern, he immediately resolves to head for Gridania to find out what has become of Omega and its target.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_SEQ_04 -- After a journey spent contemplating all manner of apocalyptic eventualities, you are relieved to find Gridania exactly where you left it. Trouble Cid for his thoughts on what could have become of Omega.

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_SEQ_05 -- Still baffled by the Allagan relic's sudden failure, Cid suggests a firsthand inspection. Perhaps the waiting Alphinaud knows something that might be of use to your investigation...

TEXT_HEAVNG103_02358_TODO_00 -- Speak with Cid in Mor Dhona.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_SEQ_02 -- You quickly come upon the coeurl kitten, who indeed appears to be Shanoa. Moments later, you hear a sudden crash, and rush towards the source of the sound to find Cid and Y'shtola standing over the body of a fallen Illuminati agent. They explain that they were in Master Matoya's cave, making final preparations for a plan to cut off the primal Alexander's source of aether, when Shanoa appeared and led them straight to the goblin's hiding place. Cid relates the ramblings of the beastman in his final moments, including his claim that Quickthinx is an all-knowing prophet come to this time from the future. All are skeptical, but further insight provided by Backrix leads Y'shtola to conclude that there may indeed be some truth to these otherwise inconceivable claims. Fearing dire consequences if the Illuminati succeed in activating Alexander's third and final core─granting them the power to travel freely through time─Cid decides that you have no choice but to venture into the colossus once more. He leaves to begin his own preparations, and bids you go on ahead to the Makers' Quarter and rendezvous with Biggs and Wedge.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_SEQ_05 -- The mission was a resounding success. Thanks to your efforts, a passage leading to the colossus's third and final core has been opened, and the barrier restored before any damage could be done. All too soon, however, the resultant mood of optimism is tempered by some troubling revelations. In response to Y'shtola's frustration over her failure to deprive Alexander of aether, Mide reveals a heretofore-untold twist in the tale of the summoning: specifically, the part played by an ancient horn entrusted to her by a strange man in her youth. Y'shtola quickly identifies the horn as the lost treasure of Seal Rock─the selfsame artifact that once eluded her grasp─and the stranger in Mide's story as an Ascian. She further surmises that Alexander's third core is somehow bound to the relic, and will thus continue to drink aether from its surroundings until the land is reduced to a barren waste. Though there is some concern that any attempt to destroy the core will be for naught if the Illuminati can turn back time, Cid reminds the party that this power is dependent on the goblin girl Roundrox─the only one with the ability to access the knowledge of the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis>. Your task is clear: you must infiltrate the colossus, find the third core, and rescue Roundrox before the Illuminati achieve historical domination.

TEXT_HEAVNR301_02335_YSHTOLA_000_059 -- Having settled upon a plan of action, Cid and I were in the process of making our final preparations with Master Matoya when this kitten scampered in, mewing as if to beckon us. We duly followed her, and she led us here...much to the dismay of the fellow at our feet.

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_SEQ_01 -- With the operation to rescue Roundrox─and, in turn, foil the Illuminati's plans for historical domination─set to commence, Biggs briefs you on the details. Your task will be a straightforward if demanding one: enter the colossus through its head and delve deep through its nasal cavity to seize control of a moving platform that will transport the rescue party to Central Control, where Roundrox is being held captive. Cid and the others, meanwhile, will sweep through Midas, eliminating any Illuminati ambushers they encounter before rendezvousing with you in readiness to attempt the rescue. The goblin girl's fate─and that of history itself─hangs in the balance. Once more unto the breach, Warrior of Light!

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_SEQ_02 -- Dispatching an oversized Illuminati sellsword, you seize control of the transport platform, securing a shortcut to the heart of the colossus, where Roundrox is being held captive. Ride the platform to your destination to rendezvous with Cid and the others before proceeding with the next phase of the mission.

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_SEQ_04 -- All─save for Mide─emerge from the colossus unscathed if deeply unnerved by recent revelations. Roundrox, though finally free from the clutches of the Illuminati, is heartbroken over the role she played in her Auri friend's downfall, insisting that she will go and save her. Cid swiftly puts paid to this notion, however, assuring the goblin child that she can leave Mide's rescue to you.

Is Quickthinx truly an all-knowing traveler from the future? Does the soul of Mide's beloved still live on in the heart of the machine? Once again, each answer has given rise to yet more questions, and the steel giant beckons you within once more...

TEXT_HEAVNR302_02336_MIDE_000_100 -- I will go with Cid and Y'shtola, and rid Midas of any lurking Illuminati ambushers. Roundrox is counting on us, friend. Be safe, and I will see you on the inside.

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_SEQ_00 -- Biggs has instructions for you from Cid.

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_SEQ_01 -- With Roundrox safely back at the Shortstop─and the Illuminati deprived of their ability to manipulate time─the hour is right to delve into the very heart of the colossus. While Cid and his crew sweep the surrounding areas for any potential ambushers, you are to take the shortest path to innermost chambers of the giant. Steel yourself for battle, and may the Twelve smile upon you!

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_SEQ_02 -- The fearsome mechanical foe that guarded the core has been reduced to scrap metal by your hand. Reconvene with Cid and the others, and agree on your next step.

TEXT_HEAVNR303_02337_SEQ_03 -- You fight your way to the core only to be confronted by an inconvenient truth─with the primal absorbing aether from the land at a heretofore unheard of rate, the crystal has swelled to mammoth proportions. Taking stock of the situation, Cid surmises that any attempt to dismantle it in its current state would prove futile, and proposes a change in plans─you will return to Central Control and attempt to find a way to cut off the influx of aether to the core, thereby stunting its growth and rendering it more easily destroyed. Cid and Wedge begin to consider the details of the plan, but their conversation is interrupted by Quickthinx, who descends on a floating platform to inform you that the discussion is entirely moot─he has already seen the future, and your attempts to defeat the primal are doomed to fail. He assures you that while he is too busy conquering time to kill you now, he has foreseen that the next time you step into this chamber will be your last. He gloats that he has sealed off all other routes to Central Control save for this one, giving you two choices: abandon your mission and cede control of history to the Illuminati, or forfeit your lives. Events take an unexpected turn, however, when Shanoa suddenly throws herself at Quickthinx as he is floating away, knocking his prized “futurebook”─the source of his vast knowledge of all that will come to pass─out of his hand and down to the floor in a scene uncannily similar to that witnessed during your trip to the past. Backrix quickly takes the tome into hand, and is astonished to see that it is none other than his very own watcherbook, with the final entry ending precisely where he had left off when Shanoa knocked the selfsame book out of his hands. While many of the convoluted details remain unclear, one thing is certain: for all of Quickthinx's bravado and bluster, the future from here onward remains unwritten, and the battle for history may yet be won!

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_SEQ_01 -- Biggs briefs you on the task at hand. In order to disable the core and end the primal threat, you will first need to cut off its supply of aether─this much you gleaned from your last trip into the heart of the colossus. While the precise means by which this may be done is mere speculation at this point, Cid has determined that your best chance is to return to Central Control. Complicating matters is the fact that the only way in is through the main generators─the chamber that Quickthinx portentously warned would be the site of your demise. Though it is clear that he possesses no special insight into the future, it would stand to reason that the master of the Illuminati is prepared to meet you with the full force of his mechanical army. Ready yourself for battle, then venture back into the belly of the beast!

※To enter the Main Generators, speak with Snapclix in the Makers' Quarter.

TEXT_HEAVNR304_02338_SEQ_02 -- No sooner do you enter the main generators than you are greeted by the ominous voice of Quickthinx, who calls upon Alexander to deliver the judgment of time upon the unworthy─meaning you. Seemingly from nowhere, a smaller─though still passably enormous─embodiment of the colossus appears before you, summoning forth a massive energy field, and for an instant, time stops. The field soon dissipates, however, prompting an obviously perturbed Quickthinx to order Alexander to simply annihilate you. The colossus-within-a-colossus duly endeavors to oblige, firing a massive beam of destructive light that you are only barely able to evade, before disappearing into what appears to be a self-contained pocket of time. With even Cid unable to provide any real insight into what has just occurred, you have no recourse but to enter the time distortion and eliminate the mechanical menace.

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_SEQ_01 -- Having successfully escaped from the heart of the colossus, you share a moment of relief and reflection with Biggs, who remains somewhat rattled by what he saw within. The moment is short-lived, however, as a sudden linkpearl transmission from Cid reveals that Roundrox has gone missing from the Shortstop. Fearing for the child's safety─and state of mind after losing her best friend─you agree to split up and go in search of her, with Biggs tasking you to investigate the Collectors' Quarter, where Roundrox and Mide often traveled together.

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_SEQ_02 -- You find Roundrox standing at a lookout point in the Collectors' Quarter, where─as the goblin child explains it─she came to do some thinking. She then shows you a stone fragment that somehow fell into her possessions as she was fleeing the colossus. It is one of her precious glowstones─a shattered fragment of the <Emphasis>Enigma Codex</Emphasis>─and yet, she explains wistfully, it glows for her no more. Cid and Y'shtola arrive, and upon hearing the story, the former posits that Roundrox's experiences inside the colossus have fundamentally changed the girl─she is no longer a naive child, but one who has seen both the wonders and horrors that technology can give rise to in the single-minded pursuit of an ideal of perfection. Roundrox, her eyes firmly fixed on the future, expresses her desire to deliver the codex shard back to Mide and Dayan, a sweet gesture which Y'shtola laments as impossible, as the barrier surrounding the colossus is now all but impenetrable. With uncanny timing, the coeurl kitten Shanoa returns to the scene, mewing as if she were offering to carry out Roundrox's wish. Thinking that it wouldn't be the strangest thing to have happened in recent days, you look on as Roundrox entrusts the codex shard to Shanoa, who happily bounds away. The threat of the primal now passed, Cid and Y'shtola take their leave, the latter entrusting you with a weathered tome to be delivered to Backrix. And so you set off back to the Shortstop.

TEXT_STMBDA101_02446_SEQ_06 -- Raubahn welcomes you warmly to Castrum Oriens, and restates his position that the Alliance will not advance further without the cooperation of the Ala Mhigan Resistance. As you make ready to depart on your mission, Cid Garlond appears and apprises you of the latest developments in the search for Omega and Shinryu: namely, that there have not been any, the fate and whereabouts of both remaining unknown. All the more reason to secure the support of the Resistance, then, as the Ironworks search parties cannot safely venture any deeper into occupied territory...

TEXT_JOBRDM580_02581_SEQ_07 -- X'rhun shares with you the disturbing origins of the cabal's formation, and reveals that Lambard has been ordered to strike at a new target: the Garlond Ironworks. Rather than eliminate Cid directly, however, the Empire plans to destabilize the famous company by going after its senior staff members. Such a crippling blow to the Ironworks would have repercussions across Eorzea, and it seems the cabal will stop at nothing to achieve its objective. Lambard must be defeated.

※The next red mage quest will be available from X'rhun upon reaching level 60.

TEXT_JOBRDM580_02581_XRHUNTIA_000_492 -- Lambard's next target is the Garlond Ironworks! Aye, the company of engineers founded by the great Cid Garlond!

TEXT_JOBRDM580_02581_XRHUNTIA_000_494 -- To my knowledge, this will be the highest profile enemy the cabal has ever been deployed against. Ah, but the operation will not target Cid himself─they have a far more effective method in mind.

TEXT_JOBRDM580_02581_XRHUNTIA_000_496 -- Cid's ideas cannot be brought to fruition without a talented team of engineers, and the organization itself will grind to a halt without Jessie's expertise. Her loss would be a dark day for Eorzea indeed.

TEXT_JOBRDM600_02582_JESSIE_000_462 -- Is that so? Well, then, feel free to send the bill for any expenses incurred on this operation to Cid himself.

TEXT_STMBDA501_02519_SEQ_03 -- Alphinaud lacks confidence in his ability to disable the field generators, and so he has turned to Cid nan Garlond, the foremost authority in the field of magitek. By way of Tataru in Kugane he has requested documentation on the devices in question. Given the importance of this information, he would be most grateful if you were to go to Kugane and collect it in person.

TEXT_STMBDA501_02519_ALPHINAUD_000_073 -- I have been conversing with Cid via Tataru, attempting to ascertain the design of the generators based on our limited intelligence. Most recently he sent a parcel with some documents which he believes may be of use.

TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_TODO_01 -- Deliver Cid's parcel to Tataru.

TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_TATARU_000_010 -- You're here for the parcel Cid sent, right? Wait a moment, and it will be right out!

TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_TATARU_000_012 -- Cid regrets that he couldn't come here in person. Apparently his hunt for the dragon and Omega demands his full attention, you see...

TEXT_STMBDA509_02946_TATARU_000_092 -- Though, knowing our luck, Cid put the wrong papers in here...

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_SEQ_02 -- You learn to your surprise that Nero tol Scaeva has been offered employment at the Ironworks without prior approval from Cid, who is none too pleased. At length, he grudgingly agrees to tolerate his old rival's presence, and takes the opportunity to beseech your aid in the ongoing investigation into Omega. Moments later, an engineer rushes in with grave tidings: aetheric readings have risen alarmingly at the Yawn, where Omega is thought to be hiding. Fearing the worst, Cid resolves at once to visit the scene and asks that you accompany him.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_TODO_01 -- Speak with Cid at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_TODO_03 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_TODO_04 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR101_02928_TODO_05 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_SEQ_00 -- Cid is eager to proceed with the investigation.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_SEQ_04 -- Outside the Deltascape, your comrades compliment you on a battle well won. When Nero subsequently questions Omega's apparent obsession with determining the strongest being, Midgardsormr appears and explains that, having defeated Shinryu, it now seeks to create a mightier foe to fight. Fearing that the violence of such an encounter would be akin to another calamity, Cid is determined to stop Omega's plan. He duly grants Biggs and Wedge leave to investigate the stasis system in Carteneau, while he and Nero remain in the rift to aid you in the tests to come.

TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_TODO_02 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR103_02930_SEQ_00 -- Cid seems keen to pit you against the next foe in the Deltascape.

TEXT_STMBDR103_02930_SEQ_01 -- In the event that Biggs and Wedge are unable to repair the stasis system at Carteneau, Cid believes the only way to prevent Omega from creating a new threat is to triumph in its tests. Accordingly, he is eager for you to return to the Deltascape. Nero's analysis reveals that your next foe is capable of manipulating gravity, and in order to counteract this power, he lends you an anti-gravity gimbal which he just happened to assemble. As before, Alpha will go with you into the test world, and grant you the use of his authorization.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_SEQ_00 -- Cid looks expectantly in your direction.

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_SEQ_01 -- With Biggs and Wedge not expected to report back for some time, Cid proposes that you move ahead with the tests. Your next opponent, Delta III, is apparently a being known as Halicarnassus, which Nero reveals to be the antagonist from a tale dating back to the Fourth Astral Era. Hearing this, Cid expresses surprise at the thought that Omega is deriving its subjects from works of fiction, at which moment Midgardsormr manifests to provide some timely insight. Omega, the Father of Dragons explains, has no soul and is therefore incapable of imagination; be it from fact or fiction, it must draw upon historic material in order to create. While the revelation excites Nero, it gives Cid a moment's pause, but he sets his questions aside in favor of focusing on the task at hand: defeating Halicarnassus. As has now become traditional, Alpha is waiting patiently for your signal to proceed.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_SEQ_04 -- With each new foe more dangerous than the last, Cid seems especially glad of your safe return. Thanks to your tireless efforts, but one test subject remains in the Deltascape. Take what rest you may, lest your next encounter prove a battle too far.

TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_TODO_02 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_SEQ_00 -- Cid is eager to tackle the Deltascape's final test subject.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_SEQ_01 -- Ahead of your battle with Subject Delta IV, Nero furnishes you with some much-needed intelligence. Your opponent is a being known as Exdeath, who commands the power of the void. Like Halicarnassus before him, he is apparently the defeated antagonist of an age-old folktale. It is at this moment that Cid finally gives voice to his earlier quandary: why did Omega choose the vanquished instead of the vanquishers? Before you can contemplate the question, Cid receives a call from Biggs and Wedge, who report that they have been unable to repair the stasis system. And so it is decided that you must continue with Omega's experiment, at least for the time being. As always, Alpha is ready to proceed when you are.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_SEQ_05 -- Cid thanks you for the pivotal role you have played in advancing the investigation. Though there are many and more battles to come, you have taken a momentous step towards solving the mystery that is Omega, and may now enjoy some well-earned respite.

TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_TODO_03 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_SEQ_00 -- Cid looks calmer for having reached a malmstone in the investigation.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_SEQ_02 -- Back at the workshop, Cid receives a dressing down from Jessie for acting without due consultation and placing himself in mortal danger. The exasperated engineer subsequently notes the absence of Biggs and Wedge, who have apparently failed to return from their mission to Omega Control. Fearing that they may have encountered trouble, Cid resolves to look for them, and bids you join him at the airship landing in Gridania, where the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis> awaits.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_SEQ_03 -- Upon landing at the Carteneau Flats, Cid urges you to hurry on ahead to Omega Control while he moors the <Emphasis>Excelsior</Emphasis>.

※In the event that you leave Omega Control, you may re-enter by speaking with Cid at the Gridania airship landing.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_SEQ_06 -- Jessie is predictably shocked to hear the tidings from Carteneau. Though Biggs and Wedge will recover, Omega's threat looms large, and with little prospect of repairing its stasis system, Cid concludes that you have no choice but to obey its commands. Before long, you will be called to battle once more, and you fully intend to be ready.

TEXT_STMBDR106_02933_TODO_01 -- Speak with Cid in Gridania.

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_RAMZALEXENTALE_000_228 -- Enough, Master Cid!

TEXT_STMBDI101_03003_LINAMEWRILAH_000_250 -- Cid didn't bid <Emphasis>me</Emphasis> farewell! This is going in my write-up!

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_LINAMEWRILAH_000_240 -- Jenomis remains deep in slumber, but his breathing is steady and his fever has subsided. For now, all we can do is wait. I've sent word to Cid. I hope you don't mind...

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_302 -- And you, Cid. It was never my intention to put you to such trouble... I am ever in your debt.

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_313 -- I'm sorry I never told you any of this, Cid, but you must believe me. Ivalice has never been a mere pastime of mine. It is and forever will be my calling. My purpose.

TEXT_STMBDI102_03004_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_360 -- Cid tells me it was you and your companions who liberated Ala Mhigo. I am honored that one of your acclaim would lend <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> strength to my cause.

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_SEQ_02 -- It would seem that Cid has invited an Archon to join him on the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis>─a Student of Baldesion by the name of Mikoto.

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_LINAMEWRILAH_000_010 -- In her message, Alma mentioned a guest from Sharlayan. Someone your companion Cid Garlond believed might be able to assist the Principal's research. An “archetype,” I think is the term she used.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_SEQ_01 -- You learn from Jessie that a surge of anomalous energy has been detected at the Yawn. After concluding that this is Omega's way of summoning you back to the rift, you agree to meet Cid, Nero, and Alpha at the site.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_SEQ_02 -- You rendezvous with Cid and the others at the Yawn, and prepare for your next foray into Omega's perilous domain.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_SEQ_03 -- Omega once more sends you through a gauntlet of obstacles for the purpose of reevaluating your combat capabilities. Despite your success, however, the machine seems dissatisfied with your performance, and the ensuing exchange between Omega and Midgardsormr affords a glimpse into their antagonistic past. Cid will almost certainly have thoughts to share concerning these revelations.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_SEQ_04 -- You speak with Cid, and he declares your new base of operations in the rift ready for the trials ahead. The denizens of the “Sigmascape” await...

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_TODO_00 -- Speak with Cid at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR201_03031_TODO_02 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_SEQ_00 -- Cid is ready to discuss your foray into the Sigmascape.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_SEQ_01 -- Cid holds a brief strategy meeting prior to your first foray into the Sigmascape. Without a reference point within the test world, however, he reluctantly admits that he has nothing to share on the nature of the opponents you might face. Your only option is to go in blind. As before, Alpha will transfer his existential authorization to you just as soon as you have stepped into the unknown...

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_SEQ_04 -- You have returned to your base of operations in the rift. Speak with Cid, and discuss the aftermath of your phantom encounter.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_SEQ_05 -- Cid welcomes you back, full of praise for your adaptability in battle. While pleased that you now have a solid point of reference within the Sigmascape, he is nonetheless unable to say with any certainty if the test world is the recreation of a distant realm or a work of pure fiction.

TEXT_STMBDR202_03032_TODO_03 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_00 -- Cid wishes to discuss your next opponent.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_01 -- After Cid describes the nature of your next opponent, Nero presents you with a new invention designed to aid in its defeat─the Chocobo Brush. Though he leaves you none the wiser about how it actually works, you gather that the brush will allow you to directly influence the world in which you find yourself. Speak with the waiting Alpha to begin the next stage of Omega's experiment.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_03 -- You have defeated the possessed painting. Return to the Interdimensional Rift and speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_04 -- You recount your victory to your waiting companions, and Nero appears particularly pleased with the efficacy of his invention. He is in the midst of warning you about the brush's decidedly limited range of alternative applications when Cid receives a linkpearl communication from Jessie. It seems that Biggs and Wedge have slipped away from their sickbeds, intent on returning to the Yawn...

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_05 -- Outside the rift once more, you meet with an anxious Biggs and Wedge. Cid reassures them that, despite some minor difficulties, you have managed to overcome each of Omega's challenges thus far. The two engineers duly pledge their unswerving support, and you cannot help but feel buoyed by their infectious enthusiasm.

TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_TODO_02 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_SEQ_01 -- Wedge informs you that Cid and Alpha have already descended into the Yawn, and encourages you to follow them as soon as you are ready.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_SEQ_02 -- You arrive at base camp to find Nero sickly and irritable. Cid duly takes it upon himself to brief you on your third opponent, theorizing that the next battle should be far less complicated than the last. As always, Alpha waits patiently for your signal to proceed.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_SEQ_04 -- The Guardian lies defeated. Return to the Interdimensional Rift and speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_SEQ_05 -- After complimenting you on your talent for avoiding giant lasers, Cid expresses regret that you could not have encountered the wonders recreated in the Sigmascape under happier circumstances. But as the final battle of this test world looms ever closer, there seems little point in entertaining such thoughts...

TEXT_STMBDR204_03034_TODO_03 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_SEQ_01 -- Together, Nero and Cid present a profile of your final opponent in the Sigmascape─a magic-using jester by the name of “Kefka.” According to their research, the mage is wont to confound his opponents with subtle feints. Accordingly, Nero has adjusted his monitor to give him an unusually clear view of the battle, and will attempt to warn you of impending deceptions. Speak with Alpha to put Nero's strategy to the test.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_SEQ_04 -- After descending to congratulate you on your triumph, Omega proceeds to deliver its theory on the secret of your inexplicable combat potential. You are, it contends, subconsciously restricting your own performance save when placed in mortal danger. As such, unlocking your “true” capabilities should logically be a matter of threatening you with death... Before you know what is happening, you find yourself trapped in a prism of energy, with scant moments to live. But just when all seems lost, Midgardsormr uses the last of his strength to assume his original form, and intervenes to rescue you from an untimely end. The Father of Dragons then fades into slumber, satisfied that his guidance is no longer required... You are still reeling from your ordeal when Cid arrives, yelling about Nero. But at the sight of you, he bites his tongue, and bids you make a swift exit to the lip of the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR205_03035_SEQ_06 -- As you are speaking with Jessie, a weary Cid approaches bearing the news that Nero will be incapacitated for some time. Even as exhaustion and injury begin to take their toll on your companions, it is plain that Omega's trials will only become more dangerous. You have little choice therefore but to take Cid's exhortations to heart, and temper body and mind to withstand whatever monstrous opponents Omega has in store for you next.

TEXT_STMBDY004_03077_PHILIOT_000_083 -- Looks like I've got my work cut out for me if I'm to be even half the engineer Cid is.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_SEQ_02 -- At Black Brush, you come upon the black vehicle and its owner, a young man by the name of Noctis, who appears to be very far from home. His vehicle, the Regalia, has broken down, and he is relieved to learn that you know people who might be able to repair it. Soon after, you are joined by a crew from Garlond Ironworks and Cid himself, who promises to do his best with the Regalia. It then transpires that not only is Noctis acquainted with the mechanical soldiers, which he calls magitek troopers, but that both he and his automated adversaries hail from a world entirely different from your own. At Cid's suggestion, Noctis goes off to search for the magitek troopers in hopes of finding a way to return home. Follow Noctis and help him to defeat the magitek troopers by participating in the FATE “Like Clockwork” at the Clutch in central Thanalan.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_SEQ_05 -- After hearing about your battle with the magitek troopers, Cid expresses his interest in examining their technology, and bids you salvage their parts from future encounters. These parts may be delivered to one of the Ironworks hands posted at Black Brush and in each of the three city-states. Just as Cid is explaining that he had moved the Regalia to keep it away from prying eyes, Kipih Jakkya arrives on the scene and begins bombarding Noctis with questions. In exchange for receiving help to find his way home, Noctis agrees to an exclusive interview, and he sets out for Ul'dah with Kipih.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_GARLONDIRONWORKSEMPLOYEESA_000_035 -- Master Cid himself should be close. If you'll excuse me a moment, I will direct him hither.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_NOCTIS_000_041 -- Hey, I'm right here, you know? Now, if you're done talking about me─you're Cid, right?

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_NOCTIS_000_042 -- Not quite the Cid I was expecting, but if you can fix the Regalia, then it's all good.

TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_A2_000_001 -- Let's consult Cid.

TEXT_FESBKC003_03160_SEQ_03 -- You and Noctis return to the city to find Kipih in a flustered state. Apparently, magitek troopers have also appeared in Ixali territory, their presence alarming the beastmen and spurring them to summon forth their goddess, Garuda. Upon hearing the name, Noctis reveals that he vanquished a being by the same name back in his world, and is confident that the feat can be repeated here. While Kipih sets out to secure a loan of Cid's airship to bear you to the Howling Eye, Noctis bestows upon you his power─the ability to warp. Once your preparations are in order, you may proceed to the Carline Canopy, where Kipih will be waiting.

TEXT_FESBKC003_03160_SEQ_05 -- At the end of a turbulent struggle, you and Noctis emerge triumphant and are declared worthy. The divinity then opens a portal through which Noctis may return home, but not before Cid and Kipih make their entry with the newly repaired Regalia. Saying his farewells, Noctis climbs into his vehicle and prepares to speed off. In that instant, amidst the blinding light of the portal, you catch a glimpse of a mysterious woman dressed all in white. And then Noctis is gone.

TEXT_FESBKC003_03160_SEQ_06 -- Kipih wonders if the woman in the light was Noctis's fiancée, but the truth may never be known. Thanking you for your assistance, she sets off to pen her story, leaving you and Cid to wish Noctis well in your hearts, wheresoever the long road may lead him...

TEXT_FESBKC003_03160_KIPIHJAKKYA_000_095 -- Right! While events are still fresh in my mind, I shall return to my office and put pen to parchment. Master Cid, many thanks for your cooperation!

TEXT_STMBDG101_03184_SEQ_02 -- After a short trek to north Silvertear, you find Maxima in the company of your good friend Cid.

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_SEQ_03 -- According to Jenomis's newest findings, the auracite are creations of an otherworldly being sealed beneath the Orbonne Monastery─an ancient sanctuary deep within the heart of a Dalmascan jungle. During the principal's speech, Cid appears to deliver Mikoto a device she requisitioned the chief engineer to build, then leaves without as much as a farewell.

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_MIKOTO_000_170 -- Cid! There was no need for you to deliver it personally. A moogle would have sufficed.

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_MIKOTO_000_188 -- Of course, Master Cid. If any trouble is met, then most likely it is my design that is to blame.

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_MIKOTO_000_200 -- I sense that you are interested in the package Cid delivered. I have every intention to apprise you of its contents, but first I believe we should speak of Alma's condition.

TEXT_STMBDI303_03189_LINAMEWRILAH_000_315 -- Would you stop doing that, Cid?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_SEQ_01 -- Jessie welcomes you with the report of a new anomaly at the Yawn, and news of Cid's recent activities. The chief engineer himself arrives some time after, and, despite the dwindling size of your team, you agree to travel to the Yawn and begin another expedition into Omega's realm.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_SEQ_02 -- You leap into the Yawn once more, and enter the rift alongside Cid and Alpha.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_SEQ_03 -- Omega floats down to greet your arrival, confirming Cid's assumption that the experiments have indeed reached the final stage. The machine seems puzzled at the engineer's decision to bring the “obsolete” Alpha along with you, but makes no further objections as you follow Cid to the entrance of the new test world.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_SEQ_06 -- You have returned to your base of operations in the rift, but not before Cid was required to convince a frustrated Omega to delay an unexpected battle against the Father of Dragons. Speak with your companions, and discuss what is to come.

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_OMEGA_000_143 -- (-Omega-)Is it possible that test subject Cid's suppositions are correct? That my calculations and simulations are fundamentally flawed?

TEXT_STMBDR301_03154_SYSTEM_000_171 -- Alpha seems distressed, and Cid is nowhere in sight...

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_SEQ_00 -- Cid has vanished from view, but his voice is clear and strong.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_SEQ_01 -- Cid's voice addresses you from thin air, but even as he explains the reason for his invisibility, the engineer suddenly pops back into view. After recovering from this brief and unexpected diversion, Cid continues to share his thoughts on your next opponent, and proposes that he concentrate on devising a strategy for the inevitable confrontation with Omega. Meanwhile, you are to prepare to re-enter the test world, where the “supplementary” experiment is to take place. Within awaits a most formidable foe─a recreation of the legendary Midgardsormr himself!

※Alphascape V2.0 can be accessed via the Duty Finder.

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_SEQ_03 -- Still shaken by the spectacle of the battle, Cid commends you on your victory against the replicated Midgardsormr. The engineer's praise leads into a discussion about the similarities between your vanquished opponent and the primal Shinryu, with Cid musing that fate had a hand in the decision to awaken Omega. It seems the machine's connection to Midgardsormr arose from conflict on a distant star in the distant past, but it is the salvation of the immediate future which concerns you now...

TEXT_STMBDR302_03155_TODO_01 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_SEQ_00 -- Cid is waiting for Omega to make its next move.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_SEQ_01 -- Omega has recognized your prowess, and seeks to conclude its experiments with a direct confrontation. With the final battle looming before you, Cid requests that you allow him time to make a few important preparations. After making some adjustments at the base camp terminals and offering a few encouraging words to Alpha, the engineer suggests you all exit the rift. There is yet more to be done.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_SEQ_02 -- You gather briefly at the lip of the Yawn, and Cid explains the need to run his new device through a final inspection. Alpha seems concerned about Cid's state of mind, and you feel compelled to follow the chocobo back to Rhalgr's Reach to check on the engineer.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_SEQ_03 -- From the shadows of a pillar, you witness Cid talk through his misgivings with a bemused Nero. After a lengthy and seemingly cathartic exchange, it seems the chief is now ready for what may come...

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_SEQ_04 -- Cid proclaims his device complete, and bids you join him once more within the rift. You assume a tireless Ironworks hand stands by to assist with your descent into the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_SEQ_05 -- Cid unveils the Ironworks' latest invention: the Omega Jammer. Using the control module, you should be able to disable the machine's weaponry with a targeted burst of concentrated lightning. You pray the jammer will provide the advantage you need, as you prepare to activate the relocation device and face Omega itself in the arena beyond!

※Alphascape V3.0 can be accessed via the Duty Finder.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_SEQ_06 -- You have entered battle against Omega─an ancient weapon of deadly and inscrutable technology─and seized victory! Cid and Alpha wait to congratulate you on your incredible triumph.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_SEQ_10 -- Surprised by Hraesvelgr's rescue, Cid is nevertheless thankful for the intervention of Midgardsormr and his brood. Vanquishing Omega was the chief's first priority, but surviving to celebrate the deed appears to have been a close second.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_TODO_00 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_TODO_01 -- Look for Cid in Rhalgr's Reach.

TEXT_STMBDR303_03156_JESSIE_000_050 -- Oh, hello, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Cid didn't mention you were back as well.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_SEQ_01 -- Biggs expresses his profound relief, then quickly describes how he and Wedge came to be in the rift on the back of the great Hraesvelgr. After suggesting a return to Rhalgr's Reach to inform Jessie of your triumph, Biggs departs with Cid and Wedge. A pensive Alpha, however, remains behind...

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_SEQ_06 -- You join Alpha at the infirmary, and witness Cid's distress at Nero's unannounced and expensive departure. The outburst encourages Alpha to move along to the nearby Recompense.

TEXT_STMBDR304_03157_SEQ_09 -- Biggs and Wedge come across you at the exit to Rhalgr's Reach. Wedge helps to interpret Alpha's wistful gaze and chirping kwehs as a desire to leave on a journey of discovery. He promises to put the matter to Cid, and they later return with Jessie and the chief in tow. Cid gives his blessing to Alpha, and you join everyone in bidding the chocobo fair travels.

Omega is defeated, reports have been written, and Alpha has left on his adventure. With the most pressing matters seemingly settled, now might be a good time to prod Jessie about your reward...

TEXT_FESPDY502_03209_BIGGS_100_015 -- We've been so harried lately, what with saving the world from Omega, sorting all the data, Cid's emotional issues... A floral decoration will bring some much-needed tranquility to the place.

TEXT_LUCKBB131_03265_SEQ_01 -- Sophie and Radovan were recently confronted with the harsh realities of life in Ishgard when they witnessed the frozen corpse of a homeless man being carried past. Moved by the plight of those affected by such adverse conditions, your comrades asked the Temple Knights if they could provide assistance and were directed to speak with a man named Reese, a member of Garlond Ironworks. Radovan tells you that their founder, Cid, is regarded as a hero by many living under Garlean rule, and he sees it as a great honor to be associated with his organization.

TEXT_LUCKBB131_03265_RADOVAN_000_003 -- Their founder, Cid Garlond, is one of the few Garleans to have turned his back on the Empire and is a hero to many living under their rule. I wonder if I might have the honor of meeting him in person? At any rate, we must first head to the Skysteel Manufactory.

TEXT_LUCKBB131_03265_RADOVAN_000_008 -- So, this is one of Cid Garlond's workshops?

TEXT_LUCKBB131_03265_SOPHIE_000_009 -- Is it true that Cid is the one who introduced magitek to Eorzea?

TEXT_LUCKBB131_03265_CATONANMAMMULA_000_108 -- That is why I asked Midas's son, Cid, to aid in my defection from Garlemald, that my knowledge and expertise may be put to good use.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_SEQ_07 -- Shortly after returning to Alliance Headquarters, Gaius is, for better or worse, reunited with his former ward, Cid Garlond, who has been sent to investigate the remains of the Ruby Weapon. Although the two Garleans share a troubled history, they decide to attend to the matters at hand rather than dwell on the past. Their exchange of words is remarkably brief, and you are soon left alone with Cid, who explains that he was one of several children that Gaius had taken into his care, which apparently also included Milisandia, pilot of the Ruby Weapon, though it seems that Cid was unfamiliar with her name until now. He then returns to the task of gathering information on your fallen foe and leaves for the battlefield.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_SEQ_08 -- Cid returns somewhat sooner than expected from his investigation with urgent news for Gaius. It seems that not only did Milisandia perish inside the Ruby Weapon's cockpit, as was feared, but her physical form was fused with its core, a horrific spectacle that has left Cid visibly shaken. The Empire, not content to stop at using its pilots as disposable commodities, appears to be dabbling in implanting combat data from elite soldiers such as the deceased Nael van Darnus into living hosts, though the exact methods are as yet unclear. While the immediate threat of the Ruby Weapon has been eliminated, the possibility of ever more dangerous foes cannot be ignored, so Cid, Gaius, and the other members of the group set about learning what they can of the Weapon project. You, on the other hand, are advised to rest in preparation for the struggles that lie ahead, though it would seem prudent to first inform the Resistance troops in Ala Mhigo of the outcome of the battle.

TEXT_LUCKYW101_03783_SHADOWHUNTER_000_350 -- If Cid is as I remember him, it will not take long for him to finish investigating the remains of the Ruby Weapon. He never was one to waste time.

TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_04 -- In perhaps a few too many words, and a demonstration assisted by Gerolt, Mikoto expounds further on their plans. Borrowing the long-forgotten techniques of Bozjan seers, you must use a special crystal focus to enter the memories of those who may have seen the holy inscription required to reforge Gunnhildr's weapons. The problem, however, is that anyone who had glimpsed the inscription perished when Bozja Citadel was destroyed. Or so they thought. While contemplating the possibility of survivors, Mikoto is struck by a vision of the future. In it, she sees Cid Garlond, convincing her that he is the eyewitness you are searching for.

TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_05 -- While strangely reluctant, Bajsaljen understands that Cid Garlond is likely your only hope of forging Gunnhildr's weapons. And so he bids you go to Rhalgr's Reach and speak with the Ironworks engineers there to find him.

TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_06 -- Speaking with a fledgling engineer in Rhalgr's Reach, it seems as though Cid is too preoccupied to help. Thankfully, Jessie happens to overhear your conversation and clears up any misconceptions regarding his present commitments. Before taking her leave, Jessie asks that you proceed with caution, fearful of what horrors may be unearthed from Cid's past.

TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_07 -- Arrangements have been made for Cid to meet you at the Doman Enclave. As you make your way to meet him, you cannot help but wonder what secrets his memories may hold.

TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_BAISHAEN_000_281 -- Cid...? Cid Garlond? Son of the monster behind the Meteor project?

TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MARSHAK_000_283 -- I thought that the company should use such a moniker mere happenstance, but... You mean to say Cid Garlond owns this company?

TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_BAISHAEN_000_289 -- Please, bring us this Cid Garlond. For the people of Bozja. For all of Ilsabard.

TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_JESSIE_000_330 -- Lilja! Cid being back took a load off of <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> shoulders, not yours. Don't you have work to do?

TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MARSHAK_020_000 -- That you should know Cid Garlond is hardly surprising. I only hope he is not so engrossed in his work that he cannot find time to assist us.

TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_020_001 -- And how fortunate for us that you should also be a good acquaintance of Cid's. I'm sure there is much you must do to prepare, so I will not keep you.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_SEQ_01 -- You begin to strike up another conversation with Lilja who, perhaps fearing the ire of her superiors, quickly directs you to the Doman Enclave. Rather than engage her with more friendly banter, you set your sights on the enclave to meet with Cid.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_SEQ_02 -- You arrive at the Doman Enclave to find Cid preoccupied with the calm and quiet of the settlement, but his stern expression makes clear he understands why he has come. Though apprehensive of what awaits him at Gangos, Cid reaffirms his commitment to helping the Bozjan Resistance. Together you board the airship which bears the two of you to Gangos.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_SEQ_03 -- Together with Mikoto you delve into Cid's memories of Bozja Citadel. An arduous journey through his mind eventually leads you to a massive transmission tower, wherein you confront a manifestation of Cid's trauma in the form of Lord Varis.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_SEQ_04 -- The phantom of Cid's past is laid low, but something about this glimpse into the past still appears amiss. Realizing Lord Varis had no reason to be present at the citadel, he strains to remember who was the source of this anguished memory. In an instant his mind becomes clear, and the visage of Lord Varis is replaced by the man who shot him so many years ago─his own father, Midas nan Garlond. What's more, a closer inspection reveals he is in fact a thrall of the dreadwyrm Bahamut. With the mystery of Cid's past brought to light, you return to the waking world with the inscriptions of the blades of Gunnhildr, as well as an onerous truth.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_TODO_00 -- Ask after Cid at the Doman Enclave.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_000_163 -- Cid! Cid, you mustn't forget─this is only a memory!

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_VARIS_000_164 -- Cid Garlond, bringer of ruin. Herald of ash. Your father must be proud.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_000_204 -- Cid, look! His eyes!

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_000_270 -- Thank you for all your help, Master Cid.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MARSHAK_020_000 -- That you should know Cid Garlond is hardly surprising. I only hope he is not so engrossed in his work that he cannot find time to assist us.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_020_001 -- How fortunate for us that you should be a good acquaintance of Cid's. I'm sure there is much you must do to prepare, so I will not keep you.

TEXT_LUCKSA050_03844_SEQ_01 -- Thanks to your efforts and Cid's cooperation, everything is in place to begin reforging the blades of Gunnhildr, arms Gerolt would now refer to as Resistance weapons. Before setting to work, however, Gerolt asks you to expound on your exploration of Cid's mind. This insight makes clear to him that the weapons require a final ingredient before they can be completed─a special powder highly conductive to aether. Much to his dismay, the one best suited to acquiring this for you is none other than Rowena. At the risk of incurring more debt, he asks you to meet with her in Kugane to make an arrangement on behalf of the Bozjan Resistance.

※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.

TEXT_LUCKSA050_03844_GEROLT_000_003 -- Anyroad, yer timin' couldn't be better. Before we get to workin' in earnest, I was hopin' ye could tell me a bit more about what went on in Cid's noggin. I've heard a fair bit from Mikoto, but I'd like to know if you saw any different.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_03 -- You discuss the latest findings of the Ironworks with Severa and Cid, whose earlier hypotheses surrounding the Ruby Weapon have been proven correct. It was equipped with a synthetic auracite system designed to forcibly supplant the consciousness of the pilot with data collected from more experienced soldiers. As Cid explains it, said data was collected via magitek devices akin to soul crystals affixed to the magitek armor of high-ranking officials. This is likely how the Garleans were able to retrieve the combat data of Nael van Darnus, who was killed prior to the Calamity, although there yet remain many questions surrounding the bizarre phenomena witnessed during the battle with the Ruby Weapon. As the Ironworks engineers endeavor to unravel this mystery, you decide to consult with Gaius and plan the next move.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_04 -- Valdeaulin gives a brief account of his mission to trace the Ruby Weapon's path back to its source. It is believed to have come from an imperial base in Werlyt, which happens to be where Alfonse and the other orphans lived before they were taken into Gaius's care. In addition, a large machina resembling a Weapon was seen being transported to the coastal town of Terncliff a few days past, and the most logical course of action is to disable it as quickly as possible. The considerable distance between the suspected Weapon and your current location poses a major obstacle, but Cid claims to have prepared a top secret plan for such an occasion.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_05 -- Cid takes great pleasure in revealing his trump card: the G-Warrior, an enormous Allagan warmachina restored to working order. He proposes that it be flown to Terncliff using the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, where it will battle the latest Weapon. It seems you were the only candidate considered as pilot, presumably owing to your preternatural abilities and abundance of combat experience. Gaius, having previously taken helm of the Ultima Weapon, will provide support remotely. Before heading to Terncliff, Cid requests that you familiarize yourself with the G-Warrior's controls using a simulator.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_08 -- The Echo affords you a glimpse of events that unfolded prior to your arrival in Werlyt, and a conversation between Rex and Ricon, two of the orphans fostered by Gaius. With the Eorzean forces on their doorstep, Rex was committed to pilot an as-of-yet-unfinished Sapphire Weapon to afford his comrades time to escape. After much pleading, however, Ricon convinced him to trade places, and instead see the remaining Weapons to a safe location. The vision also confirms the theories surrounding the synthetic auracite and a system known as Oversoul, which fuses the pilot with the Weapon's core and replaces their consciousness with that of another soldier. After expounding on what you saw to Gaius, Cid arrives to confirm the cold, hard truth of your words.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEQ_10 -- Now that the true nature of Oversoul has come to light, Gaius is more determined than ever to disable the remaining Weapons before they can be deployed. To that end, he and Valdeaulin will pursue Rex and the fleeing Garlean soldiers, while Cid continues to examine the imperial facility at Terncliff and the Sapphire Weapon. Your only task at present is to relay the outcome of the battle to the Resistance members at Porta Praetoria and await further instructions.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SEVERA_000_051 -- The Ironworks have completed their analysis of the Ruby Weapon, and Cid Garlond wishes to share his findings.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SHADOWHUNTER_000_150 -- I see Cid still delights in keeping others in suspense. I can only hope he does not make us wait overlong.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_SHADOWHUNTER_200_300 -- And with the Weapon largely intact, Cid and his researchers should be able to gather a wealth of valuable information. Before it is dismantled, perhaps we should take one last look upon our fallen foe.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_VALDEAULIN_000_420 -- Severa, you're in charge here. Keep Cid and his team safe while they carry out the investigation.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_ALFONSE_200_458 -- Our sources state that the one known as the Warrior of Light was assisted by Cid Garlond and...Gaius van Baelsar, my lord.

TEXT_LUCKYW201_03895_VALENSVANVARRO_700_458 -- Did I create the Ruby and Sapphire Weapons so that you could deliver them gift wrapped to the enemy!? I can see it now─Cid nan Garlond rubbing his hands with glee at all the technological marvels we've bestowed upon him!

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_SEQ_00 -- Cid would like to furnish the infirmary with a new alembic.

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_SEQ_01 -- Having observed that the infirmary lacks sufficient alembics, Cid has resolved to furnish the chirurgeons with an additional, more advanced device. His work is nearly complete, but there is one final component that he cannot obtain on his own: three ice sprite cores, which he has asked you to bring to him.

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_SEQ_02 -- You obtain the requisite cores with little difficulty. Return to the infirmary and deliver the cores to Cid.

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_SEQ_03 -- Cid's efforts are ultimately for naught, as Inquisitor Guillaime makes another unannounced visit and warns the chirurgeons against accepting gifts from foreigners who have interfered with the trial of an accused heretic. The revelation shocks the chirurgeons, who immediately reject Cid's newly constructed alembic. The inquisitor appears to have developed a hatred for you and your associates, and it has become increasingly clear that he will do his utmost to prevent you from achieving your goals.

TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_TODO_01 -- Deliver the cores to Cid.

TEXT_XXAUSC307_03870_SEQ_04 -- Hedyn confirms that the foul-smelling, offal-laden crystal is comprised of ice-aspected aether. To your chagrin, you learn that you cannot cleanse the crystal of the spriggan entrails, as the thick coating of digestive juices is the only thing protecting you from the crystal's detrimental effects. Hopefully Cid will have developed a less irksome way to do the same...

TEXT_LUCKSA101_03941_MIKOTO_000_131 -- I have rather exciting news to share. As you may recall, the energies of the crystal focus were spent on our exploration of Cid's memories.

TEXT_LUCKSA101_03941_MIKOTO_000_141 -- Pressed for time as we are, Cid has already begun work on a monitoring device to locate a sufficient source of aether.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEQ_00 -- Cid's investigation in Terncliff has led to startling revelations.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEQ_02 -- Terncliff is much the same as you remember from your previous visit, and while the imperial troops may be long gone, their enormous steel structures still mar the otherwise pleasant surroundings. Gaius and his associates have been made to wait for your arrival, as Cid would prefer to reveal his findings only when all of the relevant persons are present.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_050 -- Now that you are here, perhaps Cid will finally deign to dispense his findings.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SEVERA_000_075 -- It seems that Cid is not in the habit of saying the same thing twice, which must be why he has been waiting for you to arrive before revealing the results of his investigation.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_110 -- In the event that my attempt to bypass the castrum's security fails, this submersible of Cid's had best be able to withstand imperial weaponry long enough for us to escape.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_100_202 -- Of course, we do not need to wait for Cid's analysis to tell us whose combat data was used on this occasion.

TEXT_LUCKYW301_03980_SHADOWHUNTER_000_204 -- Meaning the way is now clear for Cid to inspect the warmachina's remains.

TEXT_LUCKMJ101_04007_ALISAIE_100_050 -- Honestly, <Emphasis>Cid</Emphasis> would be jealous of the way that airship flies. Tataru has outdone herself.

TEXT_LUCKMJ102_04008_GRAHATIA_000_137 -- I believe this may be a task for Cid and his colleagues. If anyone can coax machina into cooperating, it is them.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_SEQ_01 -- Though Cid may be the man best qualified to gain access to the report stored in the Allagan node, G'raha Tia freely admits that his reasons for wanting to visit the engineer are not purely practical. Eager to be reunited with your mutual friend, he sets off for the Rising Stones at a brisk pace, leaving you and Alisaie to follow in his wake.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_SEQ_02 -- You get back to the Rising Stones to find Krile also returned, and she briefs you on all that transpired at the recent Alliance council. With the Empire still at war with itself, the Alliance has turned its attention to the primal problem once more. Working with friendly factions among the beast tribes, they hope to explore new avenues for peace, a development which only adds to your comrades' determination to find a cure for tempering. On that note, the impromptu meeting concludes, and Tataru suggests you wait for Cid in Dawn's Respite.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_SEQ_03 -- G'raha Tia positively beams with delight as Cid enters the chamber, and the pair enjoy a brief but joyous reunion. Soon after, thoughts turn to the matter of the locked report and Cid sets to work. Using the calculating power of a magitek terminal, he succeeds in identifying the late Owen's password, and you watch intently as the Allagan technologist appears in holographic form and explains the mechanism by which eikons make thralls of men. It is duly confirmed that, like those corrupted by Light, the souls of the tempered are subject to stagnation. <Emphasis>Unlike</Emphasis> with the victims of the sin eaters, however, you learn that one cannot reanimate a tempered soul without also intensifying the victim's fanatical faith. When you articulate this dilemma, G'raha Tia is inspired to theorize that an adapted version of memory transference might make it possible to perform targeted reanimation, and it is decided that you will rely once more on magitek terminals─this time to formulate a magick.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_SEQ_04 -- While Cid and G'raha Tia configure the terminals, you and the others are tasked with procuring supplies. Ironworks promissory note in hand, you set out for the Skysteel Manufactory in Ishgard to obtain the necessary ceruleum.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_SEQ_06 -- As you converse with the engineer, who should emerge from the landing but Ser Aymeric. Upon learning of your quest to cure tempering, he pledges Ishgard's full support, and sees you off aboard an airship laden with all the ceruleum you require and more.

Some while later, you enter the workshop at Revenant's Toll to find preparations well underway, the terminals successfully configured with the assistance of the ever-capable-if-not-available Nero. After confirming that all is ready, Cid gives the order to begin. While the terminals conduct their endless simulations, you decide to take a moment's rest...and awaken to a scene of chaos as the devices threaten to overload. Mere moments before they break down, the magick is revealed to G'raha Tia, who heaves a sigh of relief before turning to everyone with a smile. At long last, the world has a cure for tempering.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_TODO_01 -- Wait for Cid in Dawn's Respite.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_TODO_02 -- Speak with Cid.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_ALISAIE_100_000 -- Fine. I'll let Cid try his hand first. But if that doesn't work, we're doing it my way.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_GRAHATIA_000_000 -- I should probably mention that I have yet to meet Cid since waking up. Rammbroes did send word to the Ironworks, but it appears our friend has been afield on urgent business.

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_GRAHATIA_000_010 -- Wonderful news, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Tataru contacted Cid on our behalf, and he is on his way here even as we speak!

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_TATARU_000_027 -- And on that cheery note, why not make yourselves comfortable in Dawn's Respite? I'll show Cid in as soon as he arrives!

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_GRAHATIA_000_032 -- Cid, at long last...

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_GRAHATIA_000_040 -- Cid!

TEXT_LUCKMJ103_04009_GRAHATIA_000_136 -- Tell me, Cid. Why do you suppose Owen locked his report behind a password?

TEXT_LUCKMK104_04061_ALPHINAUD_000_010 -- Cid and his colleagues always make operating these Allagan devices seem so easy...

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_SEQ_03 -- Thanks to the Ironworks' ingenuity and contributions from the Dalmascan resistance, Cid was able to erect a barrier to protect Camp Vrdelnis from aerial assaults. Bajsaljen has a mind to push the front line forward, however, and any outposts established hereafter will also require similar protection. Thankfully, the Ironworks already has a plan of action, which Lilja is eager to explain.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_SEQ_04 -- The Resistance seeks to secure new outposts closer to the imperials' base of operations, but to do so will require further barriers and a sufficient source of energy to power them. To that end, Cid and Lilja ask you to place devices in the field to redirect the flow of aether towards the proposed outposts.

TEXT_LUCKSA301_04084_BAISHAEN_000_130 -- As you can see, the barrier only extends to the boundaries of this encampment, but it should keep us safe for the time being. Words can ill express my gratitude to Cid for all he has done for us.

TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_LILJA_000_076 -- Ah, before I go... Mikoto. Is there anything else you'd like me to pass on to Cid?

TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_086 -- Cid is truly a remarkable man, and I'll not deny our shared interest in the sciences. During the short time we've worked together, we've become good friends.

TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_MIKOTO_000_088 -- Which is why I wish to do all within my power to support him. As a friend, mind you. My feelings toward Cid are similar to those I felt for Moenbryda─respect and admiration.

TEXT_LUCKSA303_04086_GEROLT_000_091 -- Better question'd be what are <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> doin' here? Should be you payin' the visit to Cid in Doma.

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_BAISHAEN_000_012 -- Cid, can we assume your unexpected return means you have found a way to combat the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis>?

TEXT_LUCKSA304_04087_BAISHAEN_000_035 -- I am sorry, Cid, but I cannot allow it. If anything should happen to you...

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_SEQ_01 -- The Resistance stands ready to march against the IVth Legion in the hopes of distracting them long enough for Cid to carry out his plan. If all goes well, the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis> will be disabled, perhaps giving Bajsaljen and his troops the edge needed to rout the imperials once and for all.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_SEQ_04 -- With the D.A.M. in place, the Resistance is ready to set their plan in motion. What they were not expecting, however, was for the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis> to roar to life. Undeterred by the not-so-small setback of the imperial warship entering the fray, Cid succeeds in activating the aetherwave amplifier, and the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis> is forced to make an emergency landing. The sight of this emboldens the Resistance, and so they prepare to press forward.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_BAISHAEN_000_000 -- Blade <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,2)/>. We have finished preparations for a full-scale assault. We will keep the imperials occupied, while Cid executes his plan to disable the <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis>.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_MIKOTO_000_002 -- You have nothing to worry about, Cid. The amplifier will work. I have seen it.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_RINOK_000_003 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, it's been far too long. A pity our meeting is under such dire circumstances. But never fear, Cid and Mikoto'll be in good hands aboard the <Emphasis>Ia'sar</Emphasis>.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_BAISHAEN_000_350 -- Our plan worked, Blade <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,2)/>! The <Emphasis>Dalriada</Emphasis> was forced to make an abrupt landing after the amplifier released its pulse, just as Cid predicted.

TEXT_LUCKSA305_04088_BAISHAEN_000_712 -- Cid. Mikoto. Welcome back.

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_SEQ_05 -- With the help of your acquaintance Avilina, and no small amount of foresight, Cid has equipped the G-Warrior with a range of armaments designed to pursue and capture the Weapon. So profound are the changes made to the Allagan warmachina that Cid has renamed it the G-Savior. If all goes according to plan, it will live up to its new moniker.

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_SHADOWHUNTER_100_126 -- Severa, have Cid ready the G-Warrior.

TEXT_LUCKYW401_04031_SHADOWHUNTER_000_250 -- Once again, Cid and his engineers have provided precisely what we require before we even knew it ourselves.

TEXT_LUCKYW402_04032_SEQ_01 -- Allie has miraculously survived the climactic battle with the Diamond Weapon, only to fall into a state of severe shock. Cid has been called in to determine whether this was caused by the synthetic auracite system, but is not yet ready to deliver his findings. While you wait, Severa suggests speaking with Avilina, who apparently has something she wishes to discuss.

TEXT_LUCKYW402_04032_SEQ_04 -- You are eventually joined by Gaius, who wastes no time inquiring after Allie. Cid brings her out from the infirmary and all present are taken aback to see that she is but a shell of her former self, utterly unresponsive and incapable of even the most basic communication. According to Cid, the trauma from which she is suffering is not the result of the synthetic auracite system, but more likely caused by learning of the terrible fate that befell her brother Alfonse. Gaius reaffirms his desire to fulfill his promise to Alfonse by overseeing the restoration of Werlyt as an independent state. Cid decides to let bygones be bygones with Gaius, and bids the group farewell.

TEXT_LUCKYW402_04032_SEVERA_000_001 -- The recent events in Werlyt have had a profound impact on the lives of many, many people, but none more so than Allie. She's been in a state of shock ever since she returned. We've even called in Cid to see if he can ascertain what the problem might be.

TEXT_SUBCTS827_04057_WEAPONSGIENGINEER_000_008 -- I just <Emphasis>had</Emphasis> to know more. Even as my mind screamed “What in Cid's spare parts drawer is that!?” my hand moved on pure instinct, grabbing a signal emitter and hurling it at the thing's gleaming underbelly. I must have lodged it in between the scales or something, because my instruments now show a reading to the northwest of here...at an extremely high altitude.

TEXT_AKTKZD010_04234_FLAMESOLDIER04234_000_003 -- Sounds too good to be true, I know. Well, here's the rub: this silver bullet is a damned costly thing to develop, and they don't want just anyone handling it. Cid put your name forward, though. He thought you would acquit yourself well of this task.

TEXT_AKTKMF110_04448_KRILE_000_071 -- Thank goodness we had him and his fellow gleaners to hand, though. It would have been monstrously difficult to locate Cid and transport the Hannish delegation here otherwise...

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_SEQ_01 -- Y'shtola, relieved at the safe conclusion to her experiment, deliberates how best to augment the talisman for your forthcoming expedition into the void. Not wanting to further burden the alchemists of the Great Work, you settle on bringing the problem to the Garlond Ironworks operation in Rhalgr's Reach. If anyone can find a solution, it will be Cid and his innovative engineers.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_SEQ_02 -- Fascinated by your commission, Cid agrees to fashion a protective case for the talisman, even promising to enlist the incorrigible Nero and his trove of data on the Thirteenth. With one solution pending, Y'shtola suggests a return to the Great Work, where Nidhana has hopefully made progress on the construction of the mock Atomos.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_YSHTOLA_000_025 -- As I recall, Cid himself is no stranger to the void and its volatile energies.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_YSHTOLA_000_050 -- Perhaps this young man can locate Cid for us.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_EMPLOYEE04535_000_062 -- Master Cid? Certainly, I'll see if he has a moment free.

TEXT_AKTKMH110_04535_YSHTOLA_000_076 -- I think we can leave the rest in Cid's capable hands. Let's return to the Great Work, and see how Nidhana is getting on with the mock Atomos.

TEXT_STMBDR601_04586_OMEGA_000_062 -- Elaboration. Your chief Cid utilizes the floor as part of his unorthodox filing system, which allowed me to scan the report on the Final Days.

TEXT_XXCFST503_04522_SEQ_01 -- The <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> stands ready to bear you to the Praetorium─the fortress within a fortress wherein the Ultima Weapon sleeps. Prepare for the fight of your life, and report to Cid at the Ceruleum Processing Plant.

TEXT_XXCFST503_04522_TODO_00 -- Speak with Cid at the Ceruleum Processing Plant.

TEXT_XXCFST503_04522_RAUBAHN_000_003 -- Now, best you were off─we have work to do, the both of us. See that your preparations are in order, then report to Cid. He awaits you with the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> at the Ceruleum Processing Plant. May Rhalgr grant you strength.
